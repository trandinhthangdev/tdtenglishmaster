jump right into the video \nhelp I can't remember the vocabulary \n[Music] \nalright guys let's get started with the \nvocabulary game \nthe rules are simple \nwe take turns giving a word and the next \nperson has to give a synonym for that \nword \nyou get a point for every correct answer \nsounds good to me I'll start \nthe word is happy \num \nJoy joyful \ndelighted \ncheerful \nall right my turn \nthe word is eloquent \narticulate \nexpressive \nI don't really know any other words for \nthat \ncan I pass \nsure you can pass let's move on to the \nnext word \nokay the word is adamant \ninflexible \nI don't know that one either I don't \nthink I'm good at this game guys \nit's okay don't worry about it \nmaybe we can switch up the game so \neveryone can play \num I suddenly remember that I have some \nwork to do right now \nyou guys just keep playing I need to go \n[Music] \nhey Julie why are you sitting here all \nalone \ndo you want to join us for the next game \nno I don't think so I can't keep up with \neveryone else \nwhat's wrong \nI'm just not really good at these \nvocabulary games \n[Music] \nI understand \nlearning vocabulary can be challenging \nsometimes \nespecially when you're trying to \nremember so many words at once \nyeah exactly \nI can lend Grandma well but it's just \nthe vocabulary that I struggle with \ndon't worry Julie I can understand how \nyou feel \nI used to have trouble with vocabulary \ntoo \nreally you \nyeah but there are study tips that can \nhelp you overcome the problem \ncan you help me with that \nof course I can come to your house and \nwe can study together \nwe can go through the words and maybe \nuse some flashcards to make it more fun \nthat would be amazing thank you so much \ncan we plan it for the weekend \n[Music] \nsure let's do that \nin the meantime don't feel bad about \nyourself everyone learns at their own \nspeed \nthank you so much David you're such a \ngood friend no problem Julie that's what \nfriends are for \nforeign \n[Music] \nthanks for coming over \nhi Julie how are you doing \nI'm fine still struggling with learning \nEnglish vocabulary \nhi cats seem to remember any words when \nI need them \nI used to have the same problem \nbut don't worry I have learned a few \ntips and now my vocabulary is pretty \ngood \nthat is amazing please come in thank you \ncan you share with me how you learned \nvocabulary \nof course \nfirstly one thing I do is Select \nvocabulary to learn \nour brain usually remembers what is \nrelated to ourselves \nso learning random English vocabulary \nwill not be effective \nyou have to try to associate the word \nwith something meaningful to you \nthat makes sense how do I do that \nyou have to put the word in a specific \ncontext that you find interesting or \nassociated with your hobby \nfor example if you learn the word \ndelicious you could associate it with a \nfavorite food of yours like pizza or ice \ncream \noh I think I understand \nso I will make a list of words then find \nexamples to make it easy to remember \nand then start memorizing them \nyou got it now \nonce you have memorized the simple words \nstart increasing the difficulty \ngradually \nokay but I'm still a bit confused in \nchoosing words to learn \nmy advice is you can learn vocabulary by \ntopic \nfor example you can look for new words \nin the restaurant and start learning \nthem \nor a topic you were interested in such \nas makeup or shopping as I know \nthat sounds like a smart way to go about \nit \nokay let me take a note \ndone what next \nwell you can learn vocabulary through \npassages books TV and even pictures \n[Music] \nyes you can try to name everything you \nsee in a picture in English \noh okay okay I got it \nyour ways are amazing David \ncan you share more with me \nsure another thing is you can go deeper \ninto the root word when learning \nvocabulary \nwhy would that help \nwell understanding the prefixes and \nsuffixes can give you a lot of clues \nabout what a word means \nfor example the prefix multi means many \nso words like Multicultural mean \nrelating to many different cultures \noh I see what you mean and what about \nsuffixes \nfor example the suffix Ian usually \nrefers to people \nso politician refers to someone involved \nin politics while musician refers to \nsomeone who plays music \nmakes a lot of sense \nsmells like paying attention to root \nwords could really help me expand my \nvocabulary \ndefinitely \nonce you start recognizing patterns and \nwords it becomes a lot easier to \nunderstand and remember them \nwow that's such a good way to learn \nvocabulary \nyes it is \nand don't forget to repeat and review \nthe words you have learned many times \nthat all sounds great I will learn as \nyou said \nand it's also important to create a \nstudy habit \nhow can I do it \nI usually watch the 20-minute study \nroutine video on the channel learn \nEnglish with Jessica \nyou can search for it on YouTube \nit will help you to create a study habit \nI will definitely check that out \ndo you have any other tips \nyes what is it \nimagination is also very important in \nlearning English \nhow can imagination help me learn \nvocabulary \nyou can imagine context where the \nvocabulary can be used and you can \npractice with yourself \ninteresting \ndid you do the same thing before \nyes I did it helps me a lot in \nmemorizing vocabulary \nwow that's great \none more thing it's also necessary to \nuse the words in practice by talking to \nothers \nthat makes sense I will follow the way \nyou told \nwhen I learn the words can I practice \nwith you \nof course practice makes perfect \nwhen you retell the words to me it helps \nthem to stick in your memory more deeply \nyou have given me so many great ideas \nI will start applying them \nthat's great Julie I'm here for you if \nyou need help \nthank you so much for sharing all this \nwith me David I really appreciate it \nno problem Julie I'm glad I could help \nif you have any more questions feel free \nto ask \nthank you let's study together and \nimprove together \n[Music] \nthank you \nyes I finally won this time \ngood job Julie \nyou were really fast coming up with that \nword no one can think of that English \nword \nhow did you do it \nI don't really remember when I did learn \nthat word it just came to me naturally \nyou're really getting along quickly with \nthis game \nyeah you have improved your vocabulary \nso fast \nI have to give all the credit to David \nhere \nhe has been guiding me and giving me \nsome tips on how to think of words \nfaster \nwithout him I wouldn't have improved so \nfast \nI'm glad I could help and looks like \nit's paying off \nyou've definitely improved a lot since
