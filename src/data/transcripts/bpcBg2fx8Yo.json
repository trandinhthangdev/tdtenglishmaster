about it in english class \nthe day before i believe it'll be excellent who informed you about this \nmiss martin our english teacher told us everything this is the first play of the year for \nthe drama club yeah i think so what is the play about and i hope it \nisn't boring shh it's a secret oh come on please tell me \nit's the musical the sound of music really \nmiss martin told us so it's fantastic \nso do you want to watch the play with me on saturday night of course \ni'm looking forward to the drama team's performance i heard they practiced really hard for \nthat play \ntopic ballet class \nwhere are you going cindy hi mrs jenny i'm going to ballet class this afternoon \nballet lessons i had no idea you were a ballet student \nhow long have you been a dancer today is my first day and i'm not \nlooking forward to it my parents want me to study ballet \nwhere are the classes at the local community center \nwhen i was your age i used to study ballet i now teach ballet at a dance studio \noh i didn't realize that where do you give your lectures \neasy steps dance academy it's just down the street ballet is a beautiful dance that is easy \nto learn [Applause] [Music] \ni don't think it's simple i found it very difficult \nof course you'll need to master the steps and practice a lot but i think you'll love it \ni certainly hope so well go have fun \n[Music] topic monet's garden \n[Music] \nthis picture is so beautiful do you know who the author is \nclaude monet was a fantastic painter he was one of the first impressionists \noh i've heard that name before can you explain to me what impressionism \nis the thing is impressionist artists were not trying to paint a reflection of real \nlife but an impression of the person light atmosphere object or landscape \nwho were the impressionists some of the main impressionist artists are claude monet \nberta morsat camille pissarro [Applause] [Music] \nhow did they paint before impressionism landscape and art were often imaginary \nperfect landscapes painted in the studio the impressionists changed all that \nthey painted outdoors [Music] \nwas this painting done outdoors by monet as well that's great \nyeah monet spent a lot of time painting outside he wanted to demonstrate how \nobjects seemed in the light does he draw a lot of pictures related to the garden \nright garden scenes appear in several of his works he enjoyed painting flowers and \ntrees he enjoyed painting in his own yard does his garden still exist \nyes this garden now attracts a large number of tourists each year majority of them are art enthusiasts or \nartists [Music] \ntopic nature and the environment [Music] \nthis is a good location let's take a break and enjoy a picnic close to the river \nnice weather i usually get hungry when i go for a walk i'm all set for lunch \nwell we can sit on the grass here [Music] \noh my goodness someone forgot to dispose of these empty paper bags \nthere's rubbish all over the place \nwhy don't people throw garbage in the right place i don't know \nthese people have very poor consciousness it greatly affects the environment and \nsurrounding landscape there are also several empty cans and glass bottles under the tree \npeople should pick up after themselves and not leave rubbish behind that's correct \nso after our lunch let's clean up as much garbage as we can and get it out of \nhere okay next week we can go with some people \nwe'll clean up the trash in this park excellent thought [Music] \ntopic let's recycle \nhello jane have you heard about the new legislation aimed at encouraging people to recycle \nthey were mentioning it in the news yesterday night i'm not sure i like them \ninstead of tossing away paper metal and glass the government aims to keep the \nenvironment clean by recycling them but who wants to spend an extra 50 cents for \na cup of coffee 50 cents a paper cup only costs 5 cents more \na rather expensive price but you can also receive your money back \nif you return the cup \ni think this policy has been approved by the government come to think of it \nthis is very good for the environment yeah from now on i'll return all of the \npaper coffee cups i use good we must all recycle \nit has to keep the environment clean [Music] \n[Applause] topic growing roses \n[Music] \nplease excuse me ma'am my rose shrub is giving me trouble \nwhat is the problem it used to yield an abundance of pink \nroses \ni don't quite understand what you mean please tell me the details \nyeah now it is no longer producing any blooms \ni get what you mean that appears to be an issue do the plant's leaves appear to be in \ngood condition no not at all the leaves were formerly extremely green \nthe majority of them have now gone brown \nso i believe your rose bush needs fertilizer okay \nwhat type of fertilizer do you recommend i use this liquid fertilizer is excellent it \nwill aid in the re-greening of your rose leaves and will it flower again \nyes the plant should then begin to produce roses very shortly \nhow much the fertilizer is around ten dollars \nhow long will my rose bush need to recover i believe it'll take about two weeks \ngreat thank you very much [Music] \ntopic bird watching [Music] \ntomorrow i want to go bird watching do you know of a nice bird watching location \nthere's a beautiful park nearby there are usually a lot of lovely birds there \nwill i be able to view a variety of birds in that park yes i believe so \neven if the birds are far away you may see them using binoculars \ngreat i have a book with pictures of all the different kinds of birds it appears that you enjoy bird watching \nsure do you want to accompany me tomorrow thank you but no i find bird watching to \nbe tedious that is not correct birds are fascinating creatures \nsome birds have brightly colored feathers some birds build unique nests in which to lay their eggs \nyou're very knowledgeable about birds right i love studying birds \nokay maybe i'll go with you [Music] \ntopic trees in the forest [Music] \nwhere did you go yesterday i looked for you i went to the tree fair to buy some \nsaplings who's organized this tree fare the \ndepartment of agriculture and forestry organizes this tree fare on the occasion of tree plantation week \nwhy do they organize this tree fare it appears strange to me that you're not \nyet fully aware of the importance of tree plantation \nright you are please tell me about the importance of tree plantation i want to know about it \nin detail trees are best friends they're great source of our food \nvitamins and furniture what will happen if trees continue to be \ncut at the present rate the lives of all living beings will be in danger \ni see forests are the source of life they give man oxygen rain wood fruit \nbut do you notice that many unscrupulous people are cutting down trees at random \nwhat might be its consequence if they cut down trees indiscriminately \nthe country will one day turn into a desert the temperature will rise and it will \ncause the greenhouse effect now i understand why tree plantation is \nso important \n[Music] will you be visiting new york this weekend \nyeah i will be going to new york this saturday morning \nthat's great unfortunately i can't go with you what \nwill you be busy on this saturday yeah for the weekend i'll be

cup of tea it's not great it's a bit gray at the \nmoment it's a little bit gray and a little bit drizzly and a little bit cold for me \ni've spent a few days up in scotland as well which was even colder \nso i guess now what's it like in australia \nat the moment we're just going into summer so it's starting to get warm \ni'm envious i'm looking forward to getting back there actually \ndo you live near the beach i do yeah i live in melbourne right near the beach \nyeah and how long are you going to stay here for \nprobably just another few days actually so i've been here for about two weeks \nalready do you miss home not really \nit's nice to get out and explore and see new things and meet lots of new people \nlike yourself so yeah yeah i love traveling \ndo you so where have you been traveling recently \nwell i used to live in spain i got to see quite a lot of spain \ni haven't been traveling recently i did go on holiday to spain this summer \nbut i'm looking to move abroad very soon really \ni'm looking to go back to spain very very soon \ni would love to visit spain i've never been haven't you have you been to many other \ncountries i have been yeah i've traveled quite a lot \ni've been to greece so you know warm beautiful beaches lovely in summer \nthat kind of thing i went to greece this summer i went to kefalonia one of the islands \nit is such a gorgeous part of the world the food and food \nit's like a mix of greek and italian food together just my two favorites \nthe european summer is lovely it's a shame about the winter \ni know i'll make sure that i'm back here for the summer next time \nand you need to visit spain yes \nspain is my favorite country in the world yes i know \nit's been on my list for many years and the food there if you like \ngreek food then you're going to love spanish food \ni'm a bit tired of eating spanish food in restaurants anywhere else in the world \nexcept in spain it's just not the same it's not the same \nand i'm looking forward to having my first proper siesta as well \nhave you never had one before we need to correct that \nnot officially no so i've seen on your channel that you \nquite like cooking yes how did you get into that \nwell to be honest i learned a lot from my fiance shah \nso he is an excellent cook and i guess when you get in a relationship with someone \nyou have to kind of up the ante a bit so he was a really good cook and i needed to impress him \nwith my skills well cooking for one just \nisn't the same is it actually i'm awful at cooking for one \ni always make about six meals worth and then i have to end up freezing it \nwhich is kind of helpful but i'm not good at cooking well \ni recently moved back with my parents for a short while before moving on to another country and \nthe best part of it is being able to cook for three other people \ni thought you were going to say that the best part about it is you get home-cooked meals every night \nno i cook myself you do it yourself yeah \nthat's like my sort of agreement you can have me here and i'll cook for you \nwhat's your specialty well i did travel to italy a little bit \nactually i didn't go to italy i went to palermo in sicily \nand they taught me how to make a mean risotto but i like experimenting so i kind of \nask my dad and brother because they're the most appreciative \nwhat do you fancy and then i try and do it but with a twist \nso if they want mexican then i'll do some sort of i like to invent \nwe are quite opposite in that sense i'm very much like a find a really good \nrecipe and make the recipe see i like to find a couple of recipes \ntake inspiration from them and then rewrite it myself \nthat sounds interesting and very exciting so \nwhat's your number one recipe then i love cooking thai food actually \noh i do love thai green curry yeah \nbut i find it hard to find a good paste \nwell i make all my pastes myself so that's why mine is so good \nbut yeah it's all about the paste right so you cook that first then you deal \nwith the rest of it so you must have lived in quite a few countries then \ni have i've definitely trav visited a few i've only lived in \ni was born in australia and i've lived most of my life in australia \nbut i have spent some time living in vietnam and also in malaysia \ni've never been to asia at all haven't you \nin fact i've only ever left europe twice once it was to go to jamaica and once it \nwas to go to granada oh really you're a caribbean kind of guy \ni've lived in just in spain i've lived in madrid and i lived in \nseville the beautiful part of the world \nand london and the countryside in england i'm from bedfordshire \nwhat's the countryside like so green that sometimes when i get off \nthe train i have to put my sunglasses on because it hurts my eyes \nit's beautiful lovely in spring and summer \nautumn is stunning because you get all of the fall of the leaves \nyeah and winter's nice it does snow occasionally \nwhere i'm from it's quite flat but if you go further further afield you can go \ndown hills and everything yeah but i'm looking to live in some other \ncountries soon not sure that's one of the things that i love most about teaching and meeting new \npeople is there are so many opportunities to you know \ntravel and go to different places and places that you never really expected to \ngo to either you mean it's a journey isn't it \nyou just end up doing things that you never ever imagined and meeting lots of random \npeople like me exactly running to you \nin london okay emma well i would love to show you my \nneighborhood so why don't we go grab a coffee yeah i'd love to have a little bit of a walk \naround that sounds great let's do it and have a chat continue chatting \nokay \nthanks for watching don't forget to like share comment on my video \nplease subscribe to learn english with jessica channel to watch more helpful \nvideos goodbye \nyou \n"
