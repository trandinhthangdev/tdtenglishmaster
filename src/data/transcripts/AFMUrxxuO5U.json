as La Vie and Rose \nas I want \nI've been through a lot of difficulties \nsince I live far away from my family I \nhave to do everything myself \nI remember having a hard time \nexperiencing homesickness I called my \nparents every night because I missed \nthem so much \nbut because of the time zone difference \nI couldn't call them all the time \nsometimes I did not know who I should \nshare my problems with so I just cried \nalone \nI also have to work part-time jobs for a \nliving \n[Music] \nI want to be financially independent \nrather than asking my parents for money \nI'm getting used to working after school \nnow but at the beginning I was very \nstressed out \nI finished classes at 6 pm and rode a \nbike to my workplace \nI worked at a restaurant during my first \nyear \nmy manager was a strict guy so I had to \nbe careful with every single task \nhowever I couldn't be as perfect as he \nwanted I got scolded a lot and all I \ncould do was say sorry to him \nluckily I had supportive colleagues they \nalways cheered me up and showed me how \nto do better \ngradually I earned the manager's trust \nhe even encouraged me to try harder \nmoreover I also experienced gender \ndiscrimination at school \nthere was once when I had to work in \npairs with a guy his name was John \nhe thought that I couldn't do anything \nbecause I'm a girl \nhe didn't do anything but always \nunderestimated my abilities \nhe always cut me off and wouldn't let me \nfinish my sentences \nwhen we finished a project I decided not \nto put John's name on the report \nand I told the professor everything \nas I expected John received an F \nI told him straight to his face that he \nshould not look down on people \nespecially women \napart from that I am lucky enough to \nhave friends from all over the world \nwe usually cook together and experience \nfood from different cultures \nit was honestly a bit difficult to taste \ndifferent things at first but I soon \nenjoyed all of them \nin addition I was also worried about the \ncost of living everything is too \nexpensive \nI had to take note of everything that I \nbought in a day and whenever I want to \nbuy something I can't always get it \nimmediately \nI have to spend money on rent water \nelectricity and food carefully \nhowever I always try my best to save at \nleast one hundred dollars per month \nI also reward myself with a shopping day \nor a nice meal after working hard \nthis makes me think that life is not \nhard at all and I'd better enjoy it \nevery minute \nthen I realized that this is what \nadulthood looks like there will always \nbe crises but we have to overcome them \nto grow up \nlife is a journey and every experience \nthat I've gained helped me become \nstronger \nI hope
