\nhusband [Music] Lily time flies so fast it's already our \n2-year anniversary right so quick I'm glad I \nhad you by my side all this time so am I today I order this crab soup I know you \nlike it a lot try it so delicious I love it thank you I \nstill remember on our first date you took me here and let me try it John I saw something on the plate let me finish \nthe soup oh my God \nJohn Lily these two years with you have been the happiest time of my life we \nhave gone through many ups and downs together many challenges and grown up together every single day I now know \nthat you and I are truly meant to be together you are the one I've been waiting for my whole life I believe it \nis the time we should move one step forward Lily let's get married let's \nspend the rest of our lives together will you do me the honor of being your \nhusband yes John of course yes she said \nyes oh my God John I was so surprised what if I didn't finish the soup I knew \nyou would finish it very quickly I know you too well [Music] \nLily situation two happy [Music] \nmarriage hi Kelly how are you it has been a few months since the last time we \nmet I'm fine than thanks caddy how are you and your family never better thank you for \nasking I really admire you and Eric you are such a perfect couple though how \nlong have you been married now almost 10 years that's a long time no \nregrets no there are ups and downs of course but I wouldn't change it for \nanything I'm so glad to hear that what is the key to a happy marriage in in \nyour opinion yeah it works well of course part of being a good couple is knowing \nwhen to give each other some space that's true I see a lot of people \nwho move in together and they give up all the things which make them individuals we spend a lot of time \ntogether but we have our own friends our own hobbies and so on sure you mean you \ndon't want to be too dependent on each other absolutely although you need to \nstri a balance you need to make time for each other too of course I imagine that \nit can be easy to let things slip when you've been together so long yeah it's dangerous actually you \ncan't take things for granted otherwise your relationship will suffer one more thing is we have a cute \ndaughter I think having a child really strengthens the connection between two people of course but you know sometimes \nconflict happens the most when you're parenting that's right therefore I think the most \nimportant thing to maintain a happy marriage is sharing respect and \nunderstanding thanks a lot for your sharing caddy I definitely learned something \n[Music] \ntoday situation three single \nlifestyle hi Jenny long time no see how are you hi \nJessica I'm fine how are you never better Jenny how was your life after \nmarriage we're very happy you know we had been together for 5 years before \nmarriage how about you Jessica any news I'm glad to hear you are happy I'm \nstill very into my single life I know I know but do you have any plans for the near \nfuture what do you think about marriage to me getting married is not a \npriority right now you know I'm pretty ambitious I want to focus on my career and Achieve \ncertain results first yeah but do you think you can actually develop your career even after \nyou get married I know but it won't be possible to concentrate \n100% getting married then than having children parenting will take a lot of \ntime and concentration also raising children is expensive what I want is to Achieve \nFinancial stability before having children so that I can provide the best things to them so it's best to not get \nmarried early yeah that makes sense moreover the previous betrayal \nmade me no longer believe in love in addition the divorce rate is high in our country three out of 10 \npeople get divorced this really makes me have to consider marriage I got it but you should open up \nto people too not everyone is as bad as your ex I believe you will soon find the \nman of your life thank you very much Jenny you're \n[Music] \nwelcome situation four marriage conflicts \n[Music] \nwhy are you looking so tired these days Jack yeah my wife and I are having a \ndifficult time these days we are fighting all the time she seems to change so much after having a \nbaby really what's wrong uh it's all these little things \nthat keep adding up so I'm very tired for example I came home from work being so tired and the house was a mess \nsometimes I threw my clothes away on the floor thinking it's messy anyway I would clean up everything later but she was \nextremely angry with me about that okay is there anything \nelse another okay milk bottle story for example there was some milk left over \nshe asked me to empty the bottle and wash it but I was so busy that day that I forgot when she found out she grumbled \nall all night if you are tired all day at work then come home and have to listen to your wife be cranky are you \nhappy okay got it I think you should have more sympathy with your wife she \njust gave birth many women also experience postpartum depression so it's \nnormal to get angry easily besides you're the one who made mistakes anyway \nyour reason for everything is that you come home from work being tired but it may be even more tying for \nher to take care of the baby alone all day at least you shouldn't add more work \nfor her right back to the milk bottle you don't know how carefully mothers \ntake care of their babies just thinking about the bacteria multiplying in the baby's bottle is driving them crazy \nbesides maybe she needed a bottle for her baby right away but she didn't have \none washing and cleaning the bottle also takes time baby can't wait you know \nyeah it seems like I was too careless actually I'm not mad at her at all I'm \njust a little tired of hearing complaints all day long then you should think about how tired she is from the \nlack of sleep to take care of the baby I think if you apologize to her and explain that you are also a firsttime \nfather you may make many mistakes but we'll try to help her more I think she \nwill be happy again I understand thank you I will try to talk to her and help \nher [Music] \nmore family and relatives \nvocabulary what's for dinner tonight tonight we will have spicy chicken and \nsalmon salad wow so yummy all right sit down everybody

that we have a lot \nof differences differences for example we have dated in a park \nand it's a good place for [Music] dating okay and I was surprised when I \nknew that he was a afraid of cockroaches that's so funny you are not \nafraid of it aren't you right and \nthen I pretended that I took a cockroach and teased him he panicked and ran all \nover the park his Charming image has been tarnished in my \neyes oh my God what happened to your date I don't know do you go anywhere \nafter that we went to the coffee shop \ngood we also have opposite tastes and drinks I like cold drinks and he likes \nHot drinks it's normal right but the thing is the waiter \nbrought two opposite cups to our order so what did you guys \ndo we mixed two things together oh my God could you drink \nit it was okay and it was also quite fun \ngood when talking with him I found out some differences between \nus what is that he likes \nexercising I know you are so lazy right that is I just like lying on \nmy bed and watching TV or film listening to music you are so \ndifferent yes I have told him that I didn't like doing exercise but he still \nasked me to do that what did you \ndo can you guess break up with him I \nthink we nearly broke up because I didn't care for him anymore I ignored \nhim we didn't text or call for a week wow how about now did you really break \nup with him we are still in love what happened after you ignored \nhim he was so consistent with me he usually asked me out for \nexercising but you don't like doing exercise after some days of Doing \nexercise with him I feel my health is better I can't believe you can do that \nis this the power of love maybe and when I was running I \nstill listen to music and he does wow so two of you do exercise and \nchill out together right when are you going to introduce \nhim to me are you free this weekend we have planned to play tennis on weekend \nif you are free join with us and it's time to introduce him sure I'm willing \nto summary these words in this topic can describe relationship status \ncharacteristics or actions when dating with verbs they suggest some activities \nthat couples do when dating go out date text call ask somebody out with \nadjectives such as consistent charm single they can show some people's \nfeatures and some common phrases such as the power of love fall in love love at \nfirst sight marriage Cheryl and her boyfriend Justin \njust got engaged watch the video and see what they are going to do the days \nbefore their official wedding ceremony [Music] \nCheryl I heard that Justin proposed to you last week right yes he \ndid everything came so sudden that I was too surprised I couldn't say a \nword but in the end you said yes of course we've been dating for \nyears I think it's about time I settle down and finally get married \ncongratulations you guys make a cute couple thank you so much \nKatie we are all going to be your bridesmaids right I'm so excited I haven't been to \nany weddings for a long time obviously I don't trust anyone enough to \ngive them this position but you guys so you should feel honored wow I'm glad to hear that \nhow did your two's families feel about this they must be over the \nmoon they really did they were actually getting \nimpatient but we already promised to get married only when we feel stable enough \nyou know financially and some other things right that way life after \nmarriage won't be as difficult or stressful so tell us \nhow did he propose to you yes we really want to hear Justin is \nsuch a romantic guy well at first I thought it was a \nregular date we had dinner at one of our favorite restaurants then just hung around Time \nSquare for a while but then he took me back to NYU \nwhere we first met sounds like something Justin would do \nyes but can you believe at that moment I still didn't know why we were \nthere no way really yes but you can't blame me he was \ntoo secretive I couldn't figure out a thing all right continue what happened \nafter that I was confused because the campus's garden was so dark but then all the \nlights were up and I saw candles everywhere we were standing inside of a \nheart made of by Rose peals then I heard a song playing and I \nrealized it was one that he composed himself wait a second he doesn't learn \nmusic he also doesn't work in that field yet he made an entire song just to \npropose to you yes I was surprised too anyway after that he held my hand \nand just went on and on about how much I mean to him how I changed his life and \nhow he doesn't find love in anyone else oh how \nromantic and then he just got down on one knee and popped the question I didn't say anything at first \nbecause I was shocked and right when he was about to stand up afraid that I would reject him \nI hugged him and said yes it sounds like something came out of a mve \nmovie you were so lucky to have a man like him Cheryl yes you guys better be happy for \nthe rest of your life thank you Tiffany of course we \n[Music] will let's start planning a bachelor at party for Cheryl shall we I'm glad that \nshe specifically gave us this mission yes I'm so excited about this we have to \nmake this the best party ever for her right it has to be a beautiful \nmemory for her before starting her family life so let's decide on the \nlocation any ideas Cheryl doesn't like traveling that much so how about we just stay here in \nNew York I suggest a pool party that sounds fun but Cheryl said \nthat she had always wanted to go to Cuba can we go there it's just a short \nflight I bet she won't mind but Justin told us that he wanted \nto take Cheryl to Cuba for their honeymoon remember oh right sorry I completely \nforgot well pool party it is then great my friend is the manager of an outdoor \npool in a building near Central Park I'll arrange things with him and give you guys the address later \nwait but what about the residents of the building some people might want to use the swimming \npool I don't want to bother them it's only one evening but still H I guess we can start the party a \nbit late probably after 8 then people won't be likely to go to the pool from \nthat time that's a great idea okay I can go with that then you \ntake care of the location Mina how how many people should we invite I think Cheryl would want us to \nkeep this somewhat private so don't invite too many just several more of our mutual \nfriends and people at her workplace that she's close with yeah that sounds reasonable a big \nparty would easily get out of control what about food and drinks I still think we should have some \nfood there although I know we would just drink the whole evening I think so too but yes \nit's best if we have food just in case then I'll order some pizza and \nsandwiches at cat deli it's Cheryl's favorite cool I like that restaurant too \nI will also bring champagne and prepare some cocktails for us is that fine \nabsolutely so about the time Tiffany said we should start the \nparty at past 8 then is 8:30 okay or 9 \nif you want to we would stay up all night anyway I guess so it doesn't have to be too \nearly no I think 8:30 is reasonable because we also need a while to prepare \nthings okay it's all done now each of us will handle our work separately yes let's try our best to \nmake it an unforgettable for night for [Music] \nCheryl darling it's only one week left till the \nwedding I think we should check everything again you know just to be sure all right where do you want to \nstart well we already decided that the ceremony will be held at the local \nchurch did you confirm that yes the other day they called and it's all \nsettled perfect what about the reception I forgot to ask you about that \nit's going to be at the Manhattan hotel unfortunately the conference room \ndoesn't have enough seats so more tables are being added so we don't have to change the guest list anymore right I \ndon't want to deal with it again it gave me a terrible headache don't worry the list is already \nfine I heard that your wedding dress needed to be fixed is that okay yes no problem I expect them to be \ndelivered by tomorrow then my mom will lay out the full outfit for me oh speaking about \ntomorrow we are going to have a wedding rehearsal at 6 right I almost forgot about that oh my \nGod who knows a wedding needs this much preparation it can be \nstressful but I see you still got everything under control you're an amazing organizer in \nmy eyes thank you I'm flattered anyway way this morning I just \nspoke to one of my friends Chris he owns a studio and he agreed to be the photographer for our \nwedding some of his employees will be there to help as well really is it possible for him to \nmake a video as well that would be amazing I know you would want a video so \nI told him that already he will also take care of the editing so you don't have to worry about that \neither oh you're so thoughtful anything for you have you \nsent all the invitations uh not yet one of my bridesmaids Tiffany is doing a double \ncheck but I already told her that I need them to be sent before

I'm addicted to \nit luckily I met one good teammate she is the kindest person I have ever met in \nthis game she helped me fight the battles and collect my favorite game \nitems we got along quite well I think finally I would have one \nfriend one of in University but she still assumes I'm a \ngirl I was wondering if I could tell her the truth if she knows who I am will she be \nangry with me
