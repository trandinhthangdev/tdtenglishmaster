do you like fast food a lot then \nyeah i guess i do i have fast food like three to four times a week \noh really i only eat fast food once a month why is that fast food is a great option \nif you want to save time especially when you don't have time to cook or eat at a regular restaurant \nwell you know fast food is certainly tasty but it normally contains too much \ngrease carbs sugar and other harmful preservatives eating fast food frequently can lead to \nmany health problems ah i see i guess i should start eating less of it \nyeah it'd be best if we could avoid eating fast food as

i see what time do you have your meals i have breakfast at seven lunch at \neleven and dinner at seven i have my snacks at about nine in the morning and three in the afternoon \nwhat about you i have my meals later than you do i often have breakfast at eight lunch at \ntwelve and dinner at eight what do you often have for breakfast \ni usually eat oatmeal with some fruit like bananas or apples for breakfast i like eating oatmeal because it's \nnutritious and quick to prepare i agree that oatmeal is super nutritious \nbut i don't really like the taste of it i like eating meat so i often have \nsausages ham or bacon with toast for breakfast ah that sounds great too \nwhat kinds of snacks do you eat stacy i often have yogurt and fruit or some \nnuts like almonds and cashews what's about you i'd go with potato chips or something \nsweet like cookies and ice cream do you often cook yeah quite often i don't know how to \nbake so i often buy snacks at the supermarket but i do cook my own main meals \noh cool i like to cook my own food too it's much healthier and it saves me lots \nof money by not eating out all the time i totally agree \n[Music] \nPizza \ndialogue 5 pizza [Music] \ndo you like pizza yes i do it's my favorite dish \nwhat is your favorite pizza topping my favorite pizza topping is ham sausage \nand mushroom how often do you eat pizza at a restaurant \nonly once a

or a bus to the cinema let's take a bus \nwhy don't we take a car it is not possible to travel by car during rush hour and go to buy buses \ncheaper than traveling by car but the bus goes very slowly we will be \nlate don't worry during rush hour going by bus is very convenient because there is \na separate bus lane no matter how i still don't like to take the bus at all \ni find it very convenient and comfortable because there are so many different routes to choose from \nwe can easily go where you want it is always crowded and usually not on \ntime but traveling by bus is less stressful \nwhy instead of driving the car you can use the travel time from one place to \nanother by bus to do other things such as reading taking a nap listen to music \ni can still listen to music while riding the car as you know today is a weekend the \ncinema is very crowded if we go by bus we do not need to look for a place to \npark our car alright let's go to the bus stop \n[Music]

god no in california it is just 65 to 70 miles \nper hour on the highway oh really yes jack \ni wonder why you got a driver's license when you didn't even know the law \nbut the road is empty even so you should slow down if you don't want \nto be blown by the police there are no police here \nyup but you will probably be photographed by a speed camera \nspeed camera right the police frequently set
