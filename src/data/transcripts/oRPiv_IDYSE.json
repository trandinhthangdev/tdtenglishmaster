learned but you know \nonly a few words \nthat's why I cannot understand the whole \nsentence \nI see \nyeah you're right \nit's really difficult to find the main \nideas if we cannot hear them well \nand actually I'm quite shy when it comes \nto speaking \nsometimes the only two words I can say \nare yes and no \noh come on my friend \nyou are speaking English with me now \nI can see you're very confident \nnot really because you speak slowly \nenough for me to understand \nand I already know you through your \nChannel \nif you ask me to speak with a stranger \nit might not work \nI see it's
