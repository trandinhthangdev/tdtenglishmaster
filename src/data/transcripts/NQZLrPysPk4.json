machine and other \nappliances for laundry \nunfortunately you will have to pay an \nextra fee for this \nbut i recommend using it because it's \nmore affordable \nthan going to the laundromat oh \ni definitely will i don't like going to \nthe laundromat \nat all i understand \nwell that's all for this area \n[Music] \nthe living room doesn't have any \nfurniture \nbut the window here has a very nice view \nplease \ntake a look you're right \nthe street can be seen clearly and all \nthe skyscrapers too \nit looks beautiful \nthat's one of the most amazing things in \nthis apartment \nand

\nright \nthree times how long have you and your \nfamily been living here \nsince i was four it's about 14 years \nalready \nwow that's a really long time \nit is but my parents don't want to move \nbecause of the location \nit's in the bustling part of the city \nplus it's near my school \nand my parents workplace \nbut why does it have to be renovated \nthat many times \nit's just my dad he doesn't like \nsome features of the apartment from time \nto time so he decided to fix them \noh i see oh \nthere's a piano here is it yours \nyes it is i haven't played in a while \nthough \nso i must be a little rusty \nbut if you want to hear i guess i can \nstill manage a simple song \noh well i would love to \n[Music] \ni really like your house can you show us \naround \nof course so you're standing in the \nliving room \nhere's the couch that my dad made \nhimself and he's pretty proud of it \nthe opposite is the tv and speakers \nthese flowers are so beautiful \nyes it's large and has so many flowers \nit took me and my mom almost two hours \nin the flower market to find the best \none \nit was worth it and i that everyone will \nlove that \nas well thank you \nwell to the left there's this small \nbalcony \nbut my dad turned it into his garden \nyour dad did a lot of things to this \napartment didn't he \nbut i like it i've always loved plants \nthis requires a lot of effort \nmy mom and i also have to keep an eye \nout for these pots \nregularly it's true \nyou have to be really careful and \ndedicated if you own a garden \nmy dad said the same thing too now let's \ncome in \ni'll show you to the kitchen \nokay \n[Music] \nso here it is it's simple a table of \nford \nchairs and a cooking area \nit's minimalistic right so nice \nyes my mom likes the kitchen to be as \nsimple as possible \noh my dad recently bought a washing \nmachine too \nthat's really cool i have to tell my dad \nto get one too \nme too i like cooking a lot but washing \nthe dishes is not \nfun at all i \ncompletely agree that's why we got it \njust a little less work to do \nand here's a small room that my dad uses \nto work and it has a window here that \nallows you to \nlook at the kitchen i can't let you guys \nin \nof course but there's not much to look \nat it's really boring \ni see so where's your room \nright this way \nwow it's not very large but it looks \nreally nice \nthank you the tv is opposite the bed \nso you can watch it while lying on your \nbed so convenient \nit's true and you have such a huge \nbookshelf \ni know you like books but i didn't think \nthat you have this \nmany actually not all of them are books \nlook at the third section of the shelf \noh are these albums you have quite a lot \nyes they are all bts albums most are \nrewards for my parents \nbut some i bought with my own money i \nearned from part-time jobs \nnice and on the left it's my study \ncorner \nsimple next to the tv is my vanity \nand that's all you have quite a lot of \nstuff lisa \nyes i do my mom always complains about \nbeing \nmessy but it's not easy to clean my room \nevery day when i have so many things \ni only do that once a week i \nthink i do it only once a month \nyou're a boy scott there's a difference \nokay fair enough opposite my room is a \nbathroom \nand my parents room is at the end of the \ncorridor \nthere's a bathroom in there too but i \ncan't let you guys in but the bathroom \nis really large and there's a massive \nbathtub \nwow your house has so many cool things \nyes because my dad likes a modern house \nhe seems to be the decision maker in \nyour family right \nnot really just when it comes to the \nhouse \nmy mom is actually the real boss \nnow let's get back to the living room i \nwant you guys to taste the cheesecake \nthat i made earlier \noh i can't wait \n[Music] \nthanks for watching don't forget to like \nshare comment on my video please \nsubscribe to learn english with jessica \nchannel \nto
