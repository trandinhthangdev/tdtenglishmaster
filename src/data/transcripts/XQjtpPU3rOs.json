and anne \nwait up can i ask you for some advice \nsure what do you need advice on \nthere is this girl who secretly \nconfessed her feelings to me through a \npiece of paper \ni don't really know what to do right now \ntalking about girls aren't we well \ni am happy to inform you that you have \nasked the right person \ni'm an expert in love related matters \nhaha sure man anyway she even acted as \nnothing happened afterward \ni didn't expect it at all but i realized \nthat i am also quite interested in her \nthe moment i saw her confession what \nshould i do \nfirst of all she wrote her confession \ndown on a piece of paper \nyes yes that's right \nwith a delicious homemade lunch as well \nit was so cute \nhmm so she must like that kind of thing \nyou know being secretive and all why \ndon't you do the same to her \ni don't understand how do i do that \nexactly \nyou are really clueless aren't you let's \nsee \nyou must act mysterious \nfor example you can send her a \nhandwritten message yourself \nsurprise her invite her out for dinner \nor ask her to go see a movie with \nyou sing her a song oh \nby her roses girls are definitely into \nthat \nthat makes sense but do you think that \nmight be too cheesy \ncheesy that is exactly what is going to \nwin her over man you just gotta do it \ni am not quite sure if that is the case \nwith this one \nbut thank you for the advice i really \nappreciate it no problem let me know if \nyou need anything else \nremember i am an expert in this \nyes i will remember that thank you \n[Music] \nflowers check i should put it here on \nthis table \nthe camera is set up the card next to \nthe flowers \nawesome all good \ni wonder if anne would like this ah \nlet's just give it a go \ndear anne roses are red \nviolets are blue sugar is sweet and \nso are you my lovely anne \nwould you be willing to join me tomorrow \nnight to hang out \ni will be waiting for you in the living \nroom when everyone is asleep \nthere will only be the two of us from \nyour secret admirer \nokay this should do it jack is at the \ngym and won't be home for another two \nhours \nalice is out somewhere and is going to \nbe home the earliest so she should be \nthe one getting this message \nperfect hello \nis there anybody home oh i need to go \nanyway what was i talking about yes \nsure see you then \nwhy suddenly someone in this house

poem is really cute \ntoo \nbut who wrote this can it be jack \nno way probably not but who else can it \nbe then a stranger \nit must be jack then oh my god \ni can't believe this he finally changed \nhis mind i'm so happy \nhello anne hello my lovely little sister \nwhat made you so happy anne you seem \nreally excited today \noh yes i'm very happy indeed i got a \nsurprise \nit was so romantic you won't believe it \nif i told you \nthen tell me no i want to keep it a \nsecret for now \nyou're so lame \ni just wanted to be sure first okay \nalice but i promise i will tell you soon \nwhatever love you \nby the way how are things going between \nyou and edward \nany update and \ni regret giving him that card so much \nwhat happened nothing that is the \nproblem \nhe is acting like nothing ever happened \nlike he did not read it \nwhat if he didn't no i'm sure he did i \nlooked for the note afterward but i \ncouldn't find it anywhere \nwell did you ask him about it \nyes i asked him about lunch he only said \nhe was really happy with it and nothing \nelse \ncan you believe it \nmaybe he needs to focus on something \nelse right now \neither that or he really doesn't like me \ni guess i just need to accept it don't \nbe so discouraged \ni think you should tell him directly it \nis better that way \nyou can convey your emotions to him and \nshow him that you are really sincere \nmaybe that is better than a card you \nknow \nwhat if he likes you but does not like \nthe way you confess your feelings \nno way in hell that is so stupid and \nembarrassing i will never do that \nup to you \nis someone here why is it so dark \nanne my girl i'm so glad that you came \ncan you follow my voice \nhmm why do you sound strange today \nyou do not sound like yourself what do \nyou mean \nmaybe because i am joined by the most \nbeautiful girl in the world today \nah i waited for this moment since \nforever \nyou don't know how much i want this you \ndon't have to wait anymore
