\nsetting the internet on fire with her \nengaging lessons and charisma \nhi everyone I'm Jessica so happy to be \nhere okay Jessica and I are about to \nface off in a game of box of lies here's \nhow it \nworks upstage are a bunch of boxes \ncontaining objects neither of us have \nseen before taking turns we're going to \nselect the Box open it on our side of \nthe table out of view of the other \nperson you remove the object from the \nbox show it to our great audience here \nand then look at your opponent and tell \nthem what's in your \nbox they have to guess if you're lying \nor telling the truth we'll play three \nrounds Jessica why don't you pick the \nfirst \nbox well I'm going to take the \nseventh oh what an interesting thing to \nsee \nH okay inside my box there's a pink \nmonster foot statue but that's not \nall on top of this foot statue there's a \npotato stuck right on \nit it's like a foot potato trophy or \nsomething so you're saying it's a pink \nmonster foot with a potatoes stuck in \nit it sounds like something out of an \nEnglish literature piece gone \nwrong \nH I've got a \nfeeling that you're trying to trick me \nhere I'm going to \nsay you're \nlying oh you caught \nme aha one point to \nme okay my turn here we go \nBox 2 \ntwo acting as if it's very heavy but it \nseems to be really \nlight all right Timmy what have you \ngot well well it is a \nfigure a \nfigure \nH there is a little dude wearing \na fishtail \nsuit the outfit is a blue fish tail like \na catfish I \nguess what is that a \nthing and get this they're doing a \nperfect ballet pose right on top of a \npiece of salmon \nsushi oh and uh they have this confident \nexpression as if they've just nailed the \nperformance of a \n[Music] \nlifetime \na sushi ballet now that's a new \ngenre but the question is Timmy are you \nserving up a fresh truth or a fishy \ntail I guess you'll have to take a leap \nof faith or should I say a \npaer clever \nTimmy okay you seem oddly specific about \nthis one and it's just weird enough to \nbe true I'm going to guess you're \ntelling the \ntruth you got me I don't know how but \nyou \nAdvertisement \ndid hold on a minute

another figure a weirdo \n[Music] \none you're going through a lot of \nemotions and I feel \nthat it's a \ndinosaur a \ndinosaur yes but not just any dinosaur \nthis one's got \nflare it's wearing a shimmering pink \ndress and if that's not fabulous enough \nit's sporting some glittery pole dancing \nboots a dinosaur wearing a dress and \npole dancing \nboots if this is a lie then it's a very \ngood \nlie oh and did I mention it's mid twirl \nwrapped around a \npole wait wait wait wait so you're \ntelling me there's a T-Rex in there \ndoing the chaa around the \npole oh it might be a \nvelociraptor you know more leg room for \nthose boots but yes that's the scene \ninside this \nbox that's something so weird and I \ndon't see why you would be lying about \nthat I think you're telling the \ntruth \nyes yes I \nam OMG that figure really does \nexist Jessica \neverybody okay now we'll review some \nReview vocabulary \nvocabulary \nyes fishy \ntail this is a play on words fishy can \nmean suspicious or unlikely and tail can \nmean a story so a fishy tale is a story \nthat seems susp icious or untrue in the \nconversation it's a pun because the \nfigure being described has a fish tail \nbut the question is Timmy are you \nserving up a fresh truth or a fishy \ntail \nVelociraptor this is a type of dinosaur \nin the conversation it's mentioned \nhumorously as the type of dinosaur that \nmight be wearing the described dress and \nboots due to having more leg \nroom oh it might be a \nvelociraptor you know more leg room for \nthose \nboots face off to compete against \nsomeone to confront or oppose someone \ndirectly okay Jessica and I are about to \nface off in a game of box of \nlies \nupstage refers to the part of the stage \nthat is farthest from the audience in \nthis context it is used to describe \nwhere the boxes are placed in relation \nto the audience upstage are a bunch of \nboxes containing objects neither of us \nhave seen \nbefore \nCharisma a personal charm or magnetism \nthat allows an individual to influence \nor Inspire others the English teacher \nthat's been setting the internet on fire \nwith her engaging lessons and \nCharisma English literature piece gone \nwrong \nrefers to something that is bizarre \nunexpected or out of the ordinary as if \nit's an odd Twist from a piece of \nEnglish \nliterature it sounds like something out \nof an English literature piece gone \nwrong don't forget to like share and \ncomment on my video please subscribe to \nthe learn English with Jessica channel \nto watch more helpful
