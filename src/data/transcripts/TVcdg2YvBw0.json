are you crazy alice that's not even music \nthat's simply noise come on peter \nit's saturday night we have to do something special something exciting \nand going dancing is surely more exciting than

you \nand you are more frivolous than i am alice \ncome on guys don't argue now please \nlet's vote on it well alice and i want to go dancing \n[Music] peter and ann don't how about you sharon \ni

mountains \nwhy do you say that the mountains are beautiful and spectacular \ni prefer the beach it's more relaxing and entertaining \noh i don't know i think the beach is more boring than in the mountains \nwhy do you say that well think about it lying on the beach every day \nit's much more interesting to be walking in the countryside \nyes but it's usually colder in the mountains \ni think the beach is also more romantic girls stop talking nonsense \nhow do i look you look very pretty alice \nthanks sharon but you look better than me no \nhow can you say that you are much more tanned than i am \nyes but you are in better shape and me \nhow do i look you are very pretty too anne \ni'm sure i'm not nearly as beautiful as you come on guys \nstop making stupid comparisons let's just say that we are all different \nhey girls okay are you ready i need your advice \nwhich shirt is better according to you the red one \nit's much better than the blue one for a disco night and you sharon \nwhat do you think well i think the red one is funnier \nwhile the blue one is more professional i prefer the blue one \nso girls which shirt should i put on i told you the red one \nwith that one on you'll look more macho yes \nmacho that's the right word really macho \ni like it okay i'll put on the red shirt \ndo you agree with alice sharon about being macho i mean \ncome on jack it's
