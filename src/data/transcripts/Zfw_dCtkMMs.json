also my problem \nwithout a clear plan for learning \nEnglish I lacked the motivation to \npersist in my studies \nwithout a regular study habit it was \ntough for me to get started \nlearning English is not just about \nstudying in a classroom or at home it is \nalso about using it in real life \nsituations \nbut I didn't have anyone to practice \nwith it hindered my progress \nI also had difficulty in listening \nunderstanding and memorizing English \nvocabulary and grammar \nI didn't understand English \nconversations \npronunciation was a difficult aspect of \nmy English learning \nthis made it difficult for me to \ncommunicate effectively \nyou see with all these difficulties I \nwas very discouraged and intended to \ngive up \nbut I knew that the greater the obstacle \nthe

\nregarding listening I used available \nonline English resources to improve \nlisten English \nI watched YouTube videos I listened to \nEnglish music and podcasts \nwhen I watched or listened I paid close \nattention to the way native English \nspeakers pronounced words \nI use dictionaries that demonstrated how \nto pronounce specific sounds \nin one of the learning methods I found \neffective was surrounding myself with \nEnglish \nI changed my phone language to English \nI watched English movies and English TV \nshows \nI started with easy to read books and \ngradually worked my way up to more \nchallenging materials \nI made an effort to use English in my \ndaily life like I thought in English or \nwrote grocery lists in English \nthat really helped you can try \nabout speaking I spoke out loud then \nrecorded myself speaking and listened \nback to it \nI could recognize my mistake and know \nhow I would sound to others therefore I \ncould know where I should practice more \nto practice speaking English well it is \nvery important to find a friend to \npractice with \nit can be incredibly motivating to learn \nwith friends too I practiced speaking \nwith a colleague in the company \nwe learned a lot from each other \nI also found a language exchange partner \nonline to practice \nspeaking with other Learners helped me \nimprove my pronunciation and fluency \nI know many people who are afraid of \nmaking mistakes when speaking or writing \nEnglish \nbut don't be afraid to make mistakes \nwhen I learned English I realized that \nmaking mistakes is a natural part of the \nlearning process \nso I wasn't afraid to speak or write in \nEnglish even if I wasn't sure I was \ndoing it right \nbecause the more you practice the more \ncomfortable you feel with the language \nI have become more confident \neverything is going smoothly from work \nto relationships with my colleagues and \ngirlfriend \nconsistent practice is essential for \nimproving my English
