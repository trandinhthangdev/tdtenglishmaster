he tried to bake a cake and ended up with a \npancake that sounds just like Tom always is experimenting it's true but you know \nwhat I love my friends even when they make pancake cakes especially

be easy I'll go \nslow okay fine but if I Collapse you're carrying me back deal it's a date then wait did I \njust agree to run four miles what was I thinking you were thinking about \nbecoming a

pictures sounds like a movie plot she \nloves him he doesn't know should we do something like a \nsurprise reunion or we could write him a letter from a secret \nadmirer that sounds terribly drama atic but it might work let's do it for love \nfor love but if they argue again we're out deal this is going to be fun or a \ndisaster either way we'll have a story to tell and hopefully a happy ending for \nSarah she still loves him after all let's make sure it's not in \nvain they held a big party for \nme can you believe it they held a big party for me really tell me \neverything well it started off normal but then they brought out a giant cake a \ngiant cake how giant so big it barely fit through the \ndoor no way hey what happened next then they decided to play musical chairs but \nwith a

least he's funny maybe he'll charm the teachers like Tom \ndid let's just hope he doesn't charm his way out of homework with that charm who \nknows maybe he will we should probably warn the teachers
