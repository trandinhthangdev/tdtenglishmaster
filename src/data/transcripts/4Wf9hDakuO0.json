you should take pain relievers i already took painkillers it doesn't \nseem to work for me i may need to take a hair of the dog that bit me the night before \nwhat does that even mean that's something i've never heard before that is \nyou will drink what you drink the night before which gives you a hangover \nit's not a good idea i'm just kidding i'm going to take a break \n[Music] dialogue three \nyour face looks so pale are you sick i'm not sure i'm feeling hot and i'm \nsuffering from a headache i guess you have a fever have you taken the temperature yet \nhave you been to the doctor

that's not your \neducation \n39 education dialogue one \ni'm concerned about the local education system quality where what area do you mean \ni mean the area where we're moving to i've heard a lot of awful stuff \nas low test scores high dropout rates and issues with discipline \nthe school doesn't seem to care about the students hmm that sounds bad \ni find the issue of education there very alarming jack's school here was excellent but what about his new one \nwe should pay more attention to this issue well i think so \nthere is a good private school nearby a catholic school \nis it pricey not too expensive i know some of my co-workers send their children there as \nwell at the very least that is a better option on monday i'll phone them and inquire \nabout registering jack for next semester okay but think carefully about your \ndecision sure dialogue too \nis your ielts test okay how do you think you fared on the iel at \nts not so good maybe i only got a 6.5 \nif i want to get into manchester university i have to get a 7.5 \nis it that difficult almost no one ever gets a 7.5 \nyes it's a really high score that is really difficult to attain so which university do you plan to \nattend i'm not certain perhaps i'll attend guangzhong university of foreign studies \nin guangxo that's a good choice too at least you'll be able to eat chinese \nfood every day dialogue three last night our chinese buddy yuki lon \nphoned me oh how is she doing is she still enrolled in college \nof course she's a good student her subjects all scored a and i complimented her on her \nintelligence well i think that schools train students very well particularly in terms of \nmemorization that is why they excel in mathematics and science \nyeah she is really fortunate because california citizens are entitled to free tuition \ni'm not sure how she'd finance college with her part-time work at mcdonald's \nof course we know she's tenacious and resourceful she owes you a great deal for assisting \nher in obtaining a visa to the united states i think she deserves it she tried a lot \nwork \n40. work dialogue one \nyou look a bit tired what's up nothing i'm at work right now \nare you really okay actually i'm not very well work makes me very stressed \nwhy is that you know i've lost all respect since the firm declared their aim of sales \ni don't quite get it my sales last month did not meet the target so this month must meet the \ntarget oh i see i've been contacting everyone i can \nthink of saying anything to get a sale that's great that is what our company \nwants i know but i'm really exhausted i'm virtually begging for selling goods \ni'm not sure what to say to you i'm going to be all right i simply need to have a cup of coffee and \nunwind for a few moments i know you are under a lot of stress right now \nrelax and before you make any decisions tell me i guarantee it you'll be the first to \nknow if i do something insane everything will be fine don't worry \ndialogue too \nare you okay oh i'm simply exhausted \ntoday i worked a total of 10 hours \nwhy do you have to work so many hours i want a little extra income \nmoney is vital but your

41 economy \neconomy \ndialogue one what's the source of your excellent mood \nthere are many things that make me happy for one thing work is doing quite well \nwow congratulations what is the reason behind this \nthis quarter our sales are amazingly taking off that makes sense that the economy as a \nwhole is improving there's something i've observed people are spending a lot at this moment \ni believe this is because the government has reduced interest rates \nright my father recently purchased a new home due to cheap interest rates \nperhaps you should do the same at this moment considering purchasing a new home \ni can't afford that right now you certainly can i believe you can buy \na new apartment perhaps you are correct yet a solid economy may lead property \nvalues to climb especially the rising house prices \nbelieve me it will increase but not right now you should quickly buy a new apartment \nwhy you know you're a real estate agent oh no but my husband is here's his \nbusiness card i think he has to thank you for helping me with the sale \nif you tell him you know me he could offer you a good bargain i'll contact him thanks \ndialogue 2 have you gotten any job offers yet \ni've applied to several companies already sars isn't as awful as it used to be and \nthe economy is beginning to improve it's possible that there won't be a recession \ni hope not i've already lost too much money oh you're wealthy i'm sure you still \nhave a lot of money in your swiss bank accounts dialogue three \nexports are falling gdp is falling but imports are rising what should we do \nstart an import business what are your thoughts what kind of products are you aiming for \ni was considering japanese and american electronic devices \nyou know that sony is the best selling brand in various nations it's a good idea \nsony is a good product quality assurance okay but we'll need to perform some \nmarket research to figure out who our target market is \nwho our rivals are and who will handle distribution and so on \nyeah it's a lot of work to do but i've done it before i'll make some market research \ngreat market research is also extremely important and i will do a survey \nfirst look at wholesale prices it makes no sense to begin market \nresearch if we cannot earn a profit after deducting all transportation costs \nthat'll do is there anything else attempt to obtain statistics on the \npeople aged 25 to 40. i believe they will be viable market for \nus also look at this age group's disposable income \nokay i got it i'm getting excited already \n42 food dialogue one \noh are you going to the supermarket right i'm going right now what's up \ncould you choose a few items for me sure what do you want to buy \ni'm in need of some chicken breasts that have been sliced oh what are you going to cook \ni intend to make chicken alfredo later this week that's great is there anything else \nmaybe we've run out of milk that's right we've run out of milk thanks for reminding me \nas well as some dog food sure wait i'll jot this down is that all \nyou should also buy some fruits and vegetables for breakfast which kind \nup to you you can choose the fruit you like okay i think i'll leave now \nthank you very much not a big deal dialogue too \n[Music] there are frozen peas frozen beans and \nfrozen carrots at the supermarket so what \ni normally buy frozen vegetables and store them in the freezer until needed \nwhat about fresh vegetables they don't sell fresh vegetables here \nyep but in the summer during the summer farmers may set up vegetable stalls alongside the road or \nhave a farmer's market in town don't you think fresh produce is better \nbecause the growing season in the northern united states is shorter \nwe must rely on frozen veggies throughout the winter oh okay \ndialogue three what shall we have for dinner \nbitter melon have you ever tried it yeah i gave it a go but i'm not a big \nfan of it if you like it you may order it what about a sweet and sour combination \ndo you enjoy sweet and sour flavors could we have sweet and sour fish or \nsweet and sour pork what about some sweet and sour beef \ncome on we're in china here they don't eat sweet and sour beef \nit's sad why is that they exclusively serve chinese cuisine \nnot western cuisine plans and intentions \ndialogue one \nhey jake what are you busy with i'm working on a master social plan \nwow that sounds really macroscopic yeah i wish to contribute to a better \nsociety and how do you intend to do this \nby establishing equality for all there is no such thing as private property \nis everyone work yes for the benefit of everybody not \njust individuals what if some individuals work harder and more efficient than others \nthey will not be permitted to exert influence over others do you mean it's just as nice to \nbe lazy as it is to be hard-working workers and peasants will rule society \nthey are not as lazy as industrial owners by moving a plow a man may control a \nfactory or an economy you can learn so what was he doing before that driving \na plow what about the arts culture and higher education \nwhat are peasants supposed to know about it a former can also draw pictures \nbut i am sure that you will never hang it on your wall my plan will one day change the world \nperhaps but i wouldn't want to live in such a world dialogue 2 \ni plan to return to university in the fall for my master's degree what major are you planning to study \nwhat plan do you have i'd like to change careers i'd want to work in the advertising industry \ni understand there isn't much money in that profession but i believe it would be really innovative \nyou know this job requires creativity that's what i want \nwhich university or institute will you attend to get my master's degree i have to go \nto texas they are the only ones to offer this dual specialist and master's degree \nprogram is it rather pricey no i intend to do some internship work \nwhile i'm there i'd want to gain some hands-on experience they offer a public relations \nprogram in which i may participate you planned everything what will you do if your plans are \nthwarted then i punt [Music] what exactly is it \nit means i will try something new dialogue 3 \nwhen i grow up become extremely beautiful i will be pursued by prince charlie \nhe'll bring me into his castle and we will be playing the greatest computer games \nand watching tv throughout the day and i never have any schoolwork to complete \n[Music] keep dreaming princess because tomorrow you'll go to school early and finish all \nyour schoolwork again when you return home all my dreams are continuously being \nruined by you 44 talents and abilities \ndialogue one do you fond of jazz music \nactually yeah i used to play a bit when i was in college really i couldn't play an instrument \nwhat instrument do you play i played the trumpet during college \nwow you are very talented now

gift seriously i could draw \nreally can i see your drawings come to my house i'll show you i drew a \nfew landscape pictures do you still draw pictures now \ndrawing no that doesn't help much and i

it it's already perfect \nyou could spoil it if you modify it just leave it alone do you truly enjoy it so much \nyeah it's great you have a lot of talent you are a real painter \ni can tell you're pulling my leg now pulling your leg what does this imply \nit means you're joking no i'm not kidding your painting is \nundeniably beautiful dialogue three \nhave you any special abilities i wouldn't say i have any special \ncapabilities but when i was younger i used to write a lot and people were always surprised by \nmy poems why don't you do it anymore it was an obsession in the past for me \ni'd rather live a regular life now sorry to hear that but do you think you could have achieved \nfame if you had persisted i think possibly my friend barry is an example \nhe and i used to fantasize about taking over the literary world \nhe persisted and ultimately he was successful very famous in the literary \nworld i don't believe he was any more gifted than i was \nwhy did you quit up when he was successful i prefer to eat than right \n45. making appointments dialogue one \ncan we change the time from today to tomorrow at 10 o'clock \nsure no problem are you sure you can make it if you can't make it just call me and we \ncan make another date no don't change it 10 is perfect for me \nokay see you then bye goodbye \ndialogue two \ni thought we had a meeting at 10 am why didn't you

\nnot 10 pm why don't you tell me the appointment in the morning or in the evening so i \nassumed you meant 10 pm you are insane people do not schedule \nappointments for 10 pm yes i do that's all you're incredibly \nnarrow-minded dialogue three \ni have a meeting with mr harris at three o'clock for what \nto discuss a new business venture project is that mr david harris or mr robert \nharris i'm not certain he just addressed himself as mr harris \nwell it's most likely david i'll inquire no it isn't him so it's got to be robert \nhe is in room 306 on the third level you may now get up there \nthank you very much [Music] \n46 feelings and emotions dialogue one \nwhat's the problem what i never said anything was wrong \nhe seemed to be agitated really i have a lot of thoughts going through \nmy head right now is everything okay yeah \nthere aren't any major issues it's just a small problem tell me what is it \nwell i'm a little worried about work because i recently applied for a transfer to another office \nthat is enough to make anyone scared when will you learn the outcome about three or four days \num relax you seem exhausted that's because the job is really hard \nand i also have to study for a class at night wow you're undoubtedly feeling a lot of \npressure yes i think so i'm going to take a vacation shortly \ngood idea you should take a break after a period of hard work dialogue too \ni'm feeling very sad because i couldn't make it to wade's wedding \nhe will sympathize with you he knows that you are unable to return from china at that time \nabout wade's wife i don't like her very much i understand that \nit may take time for you to get along with kate your new sister-in-law \ni'm not going to speak with her she's arrogant and rude anyway she's your sister-in-law \nif you do like that you'll make wade awkward i know when are you going to be able to return \nhome on or around july 11th i'm homesick for home and miss everyone \nit won't be long 47 clothing \ndialogue one \nwhat can i do for you yes please i want to find a jacket \nwhat kind of jacket are you looking for [Music] this black wool coat appeals to me \nhere it is i'll get it for you to see yes however i loved a navy blue hue more \nshow me the one over there what about this do you want to try it on \ni feel this shoulder is a bit tight for me so let me get you a bigger size

you i will take your measurements now our tailor will arrive at work in the \nafternoon today what time is it at 2 pm \ni'll return at that time to ensure he obtains the correct measurements okay is there anything else i can do for \nyou no not just now maybe when i return okay thank you for visiting \nhave a wonderful day you as well goodbye \ndialogue too i want to have a traditional chinese dress like this design can you do it \ndo you mean a kipao right i want it to look like this design \ni like a black background with red jackets looks good this is a very traditional \ndesign what is its price depending on the fabric you choose \nsilk is more expensive but it has more appealing appearance of course polyester is less expensive \nhow many meters of fabric do i need for this dress this also depends on your height the \nlength of the sleeves and the neckline i want the sleeve length to be 3 4 with \nslits along the sides i got it it will probably take about two \nmeters and you also need to buy a lining for it what about those beautiful tiny \nfasteners on the dress oh in china those are referred to as buttons \nthey are known as frogs in the united states dialogue three \ni really want to buy you the plaid skirt no this design will make me appear \noverly chubby no way why you think that you're thin as a rail \nyou'd blow away in the breeze if you were thinner in fact i believe a dark hue would be \npreferable it is the basic color and also easy to coordinate with other colors \nthe whole wardrobe is dark it looks boring i think you should lighten up \nokay perhaps you're correct i could wear a lighter hue but not that plaid \nit appears to be overly childish it's the new trend in autumn do you not \nread any fashion magazines oh so do you often read fashion \nmagazines yeah i'm interested in seeing how they match the new season's colors and keep up to date with new trends \nare you certain that is all you do maybe you enjoy looking at fashion models \n48 household objects and tools dialog one \nhey chris what exactly are you looking for i'm looking for remote control i don't \nsee it anywhere tv remote no i'm referring to the dvd player \nis it absolutely necessary yeah if i need to pause the movie or \nchange to a different scene have you looked for it everywhere \nis it trapped in the couch i looked for it there how long has it \nbeen since you last saw it i was watching the news this morning i was using it to switch channels \nhmm so where could it be i also wonder where it is oh here \nin the midst of a heap of newspapers oh well i'm curious how it got there \ni don't know anyway thanks for finding it what would you do if you didn't have me \ndialogue two fortunately my roommate moved to another apartment \nwhy did you say that she was always utilizing my items without my permission \nshe arbitrarily used my ruler paper stapler tape and other supplies \ndid you remind her no i have not you know it might be tough to mention \nthese topics with friends or roommates at times you should have probably stated the \nground rules first you wouldn't have been so irritated if she hadn't utilized your belongings \nyes i will notify my roommate not to use my belongings without my consent the next time \nor even better i won't have a roommate that would save a lot of time and effort \nlive and learn as they say maybe you're right 49 politics \ndialogue one who are you going to vote for \nthat is a secret i don't think i need to tell you really but i can tell you i voted for \nhollins allen's why he's such an idiot \noh so you must have voted for roberts sure i did he has very serious plans for \nactual transformation and how do you suppose he'll perform all that he's told \nthere's a budget surplus the government has extra money it's not enough for all his schemes he \nattends to boost taxes i'm willing to spend a bit more if it means a better quality of life for all \nof us pay more taxes i don't want to \nwhy although holland stated that he would not raise taxes this does not make him a good president \nas a result he is a low-cost president he'd let me spend my money as i wanted \ninstead of paying more taxes why don't you agree to pile more taxes \nobviously not they didn't earn it i did so i want to spend on what i want \nwhat about those less fortunate than us are you going to take care of them \ni suppose so if individuals like you aren't willing to do it do you believe you have all the answers \nat the very least i'm considering the questions dialogue 2 \n[Music] \ni'm sure you're relieved your time on the city council is done \nyeah it's really a lot of pressure and sometimes it was a headache \nwhy do you say that you can satisfy some of the people all the time and all of the people some of \nthe time abraham lincoln observed but he can't satisfy all the people all the time \nthat quote i believe is incorrect i believe it was fool the people rather than pleasing the people \nyou know there was no way you could please everyone all the time that's quite typical someone will always \nobject to something no matter what you say or do i'm not sure why people like politics so \nmuch it always makes them stressed it's worth getting into politics \nand i was just elected to the city council consider working in state or federal government \nwell i must say that i appreciate your behavior if only more people were like you it \nwould be worthwhile 50 media \ndialogue one [Applause] \nwhat are you now reading oh i see there's a topic in the paper i'm not sure whether i agree with the \nauthor what is the article about i believe his political viewpoints are \nskewed everyone has their own opinion i think the journalist should not put \nhis personal opinion in the article except for an editorial story \noh my each newspaper has its own style some papers are liberal while others are \nconservative i know but this author appears to be prejudiced toward the president \nand you don't agree honestly his point is very convincing \nsimply consider what he says will you remember it i'm still trying to do that \nit is beneficial to read stuff with which you disagree it helps to keep your mind sharp \nyeah this newspaper makes me unable to refute because my theoretical point is too sketchy \nsee that is true for everyone and it is wonderful to recognize that \njust wait till i read another tale in favor of the president dialogue two \n[Music] [Applause] \ni don't believe the station does a good job of covering the news i don't agree being a news director must \nbe a demanding job so what is its difficulty they must pick which news is the most \nsignificant or what to start with this is what draws viewers in \nthat shouldn't be that difficult it is just what is happening around the globe \nno not always perhaps they want to start with a less important story that hasn't yet been reported \nthen they must select whether to do a live interview a short video or a long video \nit shouldn't be an issue because there is so much news however everything must be timed to the \nsecond the newscasters must practice pronouncing the names of overseas cities \nand leaders furthermore they cannot be a second too short or a second too long \nhow did you know all this i have a master's degree in journalism and have taken some broadcasting classes \ni also did a radio program or a public service announcement you have a lot of talent \nno not at all oh and did i mention that i also did community news for a radio station \ndialogue 3 which newspaper do you like to read \nthe star tribune is my go-to source for breaking news however for local events i \nlike the post review what about the cambridge oh their news is not about what i'm \ninterested in i enjoy the editorials in the star tribune particularly those by the guest \neditor realism i'm thinking of sending an editorial to them \nreally what subject will it be about my thoughts on zoning rules and \nrestrictions i believe the city is not doing enough to curb urban sprawl \ni concur that's a terrific idea for a topic on that point i believe everyone would \nagree with you um have you forgotten about the developers of real estate \nif i fired some bullets at them they'd be as enraged as hornets \nhowever it is ultimately up to the city council to enact zoning rules and boundaries \nall right i'll do it then thanks for watching don't forget to like share \ncomment on my video please subscribe to learn english with jessica channel to watch more helpful \nvideos goodbye \n"
