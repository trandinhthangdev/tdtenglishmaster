let's watch the following video \nto learn about the house selling process \nHiring the Broker \ndialog 1 \nhiring the broker \n[Music] \nhello this is one mount properties how \nmay i help you \nhello i'm moving in a few months so i'm \nlooking to sell my current house \nbecause this might take a lot of time \nand i'm not very knowledgeable about \nselling because this might take a lot of

jim chen \nmr chen could you tell me more about \nyour current house \nit's a two beds two bath house in west \nphilly my wife and i have only stayed \nthere for two years we're hoping we can \nsell it for six hundred fifty thousand \ndollars \nthat's a bit higher than the market \nprice but we'll need to view the house \nbefore we can decide anything \nof course can you come over this \nsaturday at 2 p.m \n2 p.m is perfect \ngreat i'll email you the address and \ndirections to my house later \nthank you we'll send you information \nabout the contract let's talk more when \nwe meet \nalright thanks \n[Music] \nMarketing the House \ndialogue 2 marketing the house \n[Music] \ngood afternoon mr chen i'm harris from \none mount properties \nhello harris just call me jim please \nthanks for coming \nmy pleasure your house looks splendid \nseems like it's in great shape \nthanks shall we go inside \nof course \n[Music] \nthis is our living room the kitchen and \ndining room are over there the bathroom \nis on the right and there's another \nbathroom on the second floor let's go \nupstairs \nokay everything looks great so far \nthis is our bedroom the bathroom is \nright next to it and over there is the \nbedroom for guests it's a bit smaller \nthanks for showing me the house it looks \namazing \nthanks when can you start showing the \nhouse what do i need to do \nwe just need some home upgrades and then \ni can start showing the house next month \nyou don't have to be here when \nprospective buyers come over to view the \nhouse \nplease leave everything to us we'll take \ncare of every detail \ni'm glad to hear that thanks \n[Music] \ndialog 3 setting a price \nSetting a Price \n[Music] \nwhat do you think of the condition of \nthe house \nwell let me see \nthe house is not too big but it looks \nnew and cozy the location is also great \nthe house is close to the city center \nthe neighborhood is safe and quiet and \nthere are supermarkets and schools \nnearby \nso \nwhat price do you think is suitable \ncan we sell the house for 650 thousand \nhmm \nthat's still a pretty high price \ncompared to the prices of other houses \nin the area \nbut since the house is in good condition \ni think we can try selling it at five \nhundred and eighty thousand dollars \ni realize that six hundred fifty \nthousand dollars is a bit high but \nshouldn't we set the price really high \nat first because the buyers will \nnegotiate after that anyway \ni think it's best if we set a suitable \nprice if you set a high price potential \nbuyers may leave right away \nokay i guess that makes sense \n[Music] \ndialogue 4 signing the contract \nSigning the Contract \n[Music] \nas we discussed last time one mount \nproperties will take care of everything \nfrom a to z \nwe will help you stage your house and \nprepare it for sale as well as schedule \nshowings and manage all the needed \npaperwork \nmy wife and i both work full time so we \ndon't have enough time we're

price of the house \nthere are more details about the payment \nhere please go through everything and \nlet me know if you have any questions \n[Music] \nokay everything looks good let's sign \nthe contract \ngreat \n[Music] \ndialog 5 \nFixing the House \nfixing the house \nis there anything in the house you think \ni should prepare \nthe house looks good overall but there \nare places you can certainly fix up if \nyou want the house to look even better \nlike what \nthe walls over here have some stains you \ncan try using warm water and soap to \nclean and remove the stains \nthe carpet in the living room looks a \nbit old so maybe you should have it \ncleaned as well \nmy last recommendation is that you can \nconsider changing the light bulbs to \nmake the rooms look brighter and bigger \nthanks for your suggestions i'll fix \neverything as soon as i can \nBefore a House Showing \ndialog 6 before a house showing \nhello jim this is harris from one mount \nproperties i have
