of an engine failure but I didn't have a repair kit \nand then I was so regretful I should have brought the repair kit right \nyou know what squirrel saw me he crossed the street he panicked and ran away \noh as if he knew he had made a mistake I think so \nso how did you go home oh the story was even worse the car was \ngoing back very slowly because the engine was broken the cars behind beat their horns and \ncomplained and told me to hurry but I couldn't I should have chosen another road that \nis wider why didn't you stop and let another car go first I wish so but the road goes one way and \nit only has enough one car to go I felt frustrated but also apologetic \nyou should have called for help sooner I thought so too but also fortunately the road is short \nand I tried to press on the accelerator fortunately it went faster \nit is good I was so happy but because I was so happy I crashed \ninto another car why are you so unlucky you should have \nbeen careful I don't know I was so scared and got out of the car \napologizing to him immediately and promising to be careful \nso what did he say can you guess I was so scared when I saw him \nwhy were you scared of him if you were

come and take all my money oh my God you should have called the \npolice immediately because I was so scared I gave all my money to make up for it but more \nsurprising you know what what \nI helped him what that car got into a quagmire thanks to \nme hitting it it got out of that Quagmire oh God \nI was very relieved when I resolved the misunderstanding with the other car owner \nthat's great [Music] right after that I got some lessons that \nI have to bear in mind you should be more careful on the road \nexactly and I should have prepared everything for a trip especially for unexpected situations \nluckily you go home safely and there was not any injury that's right \n[Music] \nMary asked her husband Jack to help improve her driving skills but things didn't go the way she expected
