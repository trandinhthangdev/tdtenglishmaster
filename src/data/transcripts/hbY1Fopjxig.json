think but where I \nlive it's usually sunny in the \nsummer how about the houses and \nbuildings most of the architecture is \nvery ancient which gives you a nostalgic \nfeeling \nand British \npeople uh British people are well known \nto be extremely \npolite you'll hear thank you or sorry \nall day \nthere yeah I heard about that too so \nwhat is the thing you love most in the \nUK I really love the peaceful atmosphere \nthere I think British people love the \nsilence \ntoo they don't talk loud LLY in public \nspaces well that sounds like a totally \ndifferent life to \nme maybe because I
