\ni agree that can be very useful \ntell me how do you define success as a \nsoftware developer \ni think of software development as a \nlengthy process \na successful developer should not only \nbe

best \npeople i have ever worked with \ni say with and not four because he never \ntreated me as a subordinate \nhe always treats every employee the same \nway and listens to their wants and needs \nthat is very valuable i'm happy to \ninform you that our boss here is pretty \nmuch \nthe same that's really good to hear \nis there anything else that you want to \nknow about me \nlet me see oh
