gone on a mission for one week what's the problem man \nwell no problem i just want to ask you something about running a business \nwe can exchange through the call if not important fine \nbut wait you're overseas so do you return home in time for emma's birthday \ngonna return right on her birthday you won't probably buy gifts for her will \nyou no i tend to buy a birthday present when i go back to america how about you \nnot yet recently i've been too busy to choose a gift for emma will you go with me \ncertainly exactly when seem to not have enough time because \nyou'll return home right on her birthday so in the afternoon of that day when you \njust get back that's fine i'll pick you up around three or four \no'clock when being on the way back from the airport okay let's do that \n[Music] \nhey tom you're late my flight was delayed one hour damn it \nsorry my man it doesn't matter i just simply said it \nnow where do you go i want to go to the mall of america what \nabout your idea mall of america is fine let's go there \n[Music] what kind of gift do you prepare for her birthday tom \ni'm thinking i don't know the way how to choose a gift for a girl \nmany ideal items for them is like lipstick accessories skin pair products \nand so on i tend to buy a violin for her because she wants to \nbegin the musical journey from playing instruments sounds great i think she'll be very \ndelighted to receive it once there there are many kinds of violins for you to choose from \num [Music] eventually we're there mall of america \nlet's go to the third floor first where they sell several musical instruments \nokay it'll take much time for us to choose why did you choose the violin as a \nbirthday gift not saxophone harmonica or cello \nthat day when you were on a business trip our high school grade had a meeting do you remember that \ni remembered that emma said she wanted to learn to play the violin so i decided to buy the violin as her birthday \npresent so it's like that welcome to the world of violin \nexcuse me i'm looking for some designs of violin this year can you show me \nwill you buy it for a novice person knowing to play or professional player \nbecause the violin is divided into different levels which depends on the level of the violin player \nfor a fresh beginner she uses it for a long time she wants to become a professional player \ntherefore i want a violin that has wood material that is of the highest quality \nour store has violins that are built from cold and dried wood and assembled by highly skilled craftsmen \ni think violin with that quality is suitable for emma to learn and further develop her musical career later as well \ni go along with that excuse me show me those violins thank you \nthis way please [Music] \ni will browse i'll call you later thanks \ntom which color do you prefer i'm considering brown and black \nlet me see personally i prefer the black to the brown \nbut emma likes her musical instruments and light colors except for piano and grand piano just \nblack and white i think so but the brown color is a bit dark \ni want a lighter but the lighter violins here don't catch my eye \nthey're over there kevin i see something that you like oh look at these exactly what i'm \nfinding dude i want to take it at first sight it's got light brown and extremely high \nquality let's pay for it now excuse me \nwrap it for me and how much is the total your payment is two thousand two hundred \ndollars here you are thank you very much \nyou and goodbye sir hope you'll be back soon tom \ndid you think of what gift you will give emma yes i'll buy some perfume for her i saw \nwhen when we were going across that store what brand \nhermes hermes twenty-four fiber its fragrance is so mild and brings us a \npleasant feeling i think it is suitable for her she is also a perfume collector as well \nthat's a bright idea take it tom surely \nkevin do you think we need to create our own birthday card for emma this makes our gift more meaningful \ntotally agree let's do that together [Music] \nAt the birthday party \nat the birthday party [Music] \noh hi my boys wow i'm so excited just looking at the \ngifts that both of you brought come on guys you have a fabulous birthday emma wish \nyou all the best i hope you have a fantastic day and a fantastic year to come \nmany thanks tom and kevin wow how big the birthday party is emma \nbecause i want to celebrate my 25th birthday party as fancy as possible \n[Music] hey emma what gifts do you like to receive on your birthday \neverything people give me it doesn't matter okay let's sit down to chat together it \nhas been a long time since we have talked in person now let's unwrap your gift \nand i guess you'll be on cloud nine when you see the two birthday gifts \nreally what kind of present could make me feel like that \nopen it and you'll know oh my gosh i can't believe my eyes \none violin and one hermes perfume i really love them i love you guys \nhow did you know i had a plan to learn play violin who told you \nkevin chose the violin for you tell me how you know kevin i'm so \nsurprised i simply heard you say that you wanted to learn at the meeting of our high \nschool grade oh i like that you remember that i'm so \nappreciative tom you bought perfume which i'm gonna buy to collect you're the best guys \nthanks a ton no problem our bestie \nemma today is your 25th birthday so what was your most memorable birthday except \nthis one i think my five-year-old birthday has \nbeen the most memorable until now why \nmy parents gave me a grand piano and my grandparents gave me a guitar as my birthday present \nwell those are two great gifts yes but i didn't like or \nin other words i hated playing musical instruments at that time \ni felt not being gifted with enjoying music but \nyou learned unhappily because they forced you to do it \ni couldn't say that because thanks to it i realized gradually that i love music \nit really brings me comfort when i'm under pressure glad to hear that \nthey're also the best birthday gifts i've ever received yours as well \nthose gifts paved the way for my career i'm so grateful \nand now your plan is learning to play the violin and seriously starting the musical journey right \nyes i want to become a professional instrument player \nemma why do you celebrate your birthday near the swimming pool swimming pool party \ndefinitely we'll have a swimming pool party in a few minutes really \n[Music] of course i didn't say anything to anyone \ni take it by surprise surely i have to push both of you down into the pool \nno way you better believe it this talk is enough and let's come there \nand let your hair down at my birthday party let's go \n[Music] picnic \nanna's group of friends is planning a picnic date to celebrate her birthday \nwatch the video and learn how to organize a fun picnic \nokay so we all agreed to go out for a picnic on hannah's birthday tomorrow \nright yes i bet it would be fun we've have never gone picnicking \ntogether before i'm so excited picnic has become so trendy lately \ni saw all the aesthetic pictures on instagram alright guys \nnow we have a lot of things to plan first is the location \nthere's a piece of unused land near the state mall parking lot maybe we can go there it's not very far \nright it's close to all of our homes but that place doesn't look really nice \ni mean it's abandoned and no one is taking care of it we have to take a lot of photos too \nremember yes so we have to choose a beautiful place \nhow about a park do you guys know cloud land park \nthat sounds familiar i think i've heard of it before is that the new park that that was \nconstructed near the city's largest entertainment complex that's right inside that park there's a \nlake named cloudland it's really large and beautiful i think the lawns there are very ideal for a \npicnic wow check out these pictures online it's an amazing place \ni like it plus around the park there are various luxury apartment buildings it's \ngoing to look very nice in pictures yeah andy planted a lot of trees too \nwe don't have to worry if it's too sunny tomorrow plus the park is new and not that close \nto the city center so it's not going to be crowded amazing a peaceful and quiet place \nso we will meet each other at the park right it only takes five minutes for us to \nwalk there from my house so i think it's better if we gather at my house and then go there together \nsounds reasonable great what time should we arrive \ni was thinking that you guys should come a little bit early we can discuss what we're going to eat and then buy some \nfood there is a target and a bakery near my house we should also decide on how to arrange \nthings so that they look organized enough for pictures then how about 9 30. \nokay i'm fine with that how about you karen me too then it's settled \nwe're going to be at my house at 9 30 and try to go shopping at 10. we have to \nhurry up because i want us to arrive at the park at 11 sharp okay well i should get home now see you \nguys tomorrow see you bye hannah \n[Music] \nnow that we're all here let's start discussing what to eat well it's hannah's birthday so we \nobviously need a cake but a small one because there's only four of us \ni want a chocolate cake what do you think of that guys but i want a strawberry cake \nokay okay guys let's buy a chocolate cake topped with strawberries \nokay that's fine what else do you want to eat \nwe have to buy some fruit too sadie what do you have in the fridge \nsome strawberries and green grapes those fruits are perfect for a picnic \nbut should we buy a box of blueberries too i mean that's hannah's favorite food and today is her birthday \nokay then i'll add it to the list we can't forget about bread and cheese \nright the classic we can buy some whole wheat bread since it's much healthier \nwait so we're going to eat bread or sandwich i guess a sandwich is more convenient \noh i almost forgot i brought a bag of marshmallows do you guys want some \nnice here you can put it in this glass container can we buy a bag of chocolate chip \ncookies too that's a great idea i haven't eaten those for quite a while \nhey last night i looked up some picnic pictures online i noticed that most of them have some kind of sushi or rolls \nall right i asked my mom to prepare some for us it's in the fridge already \nwe just need to heat it up later using the microwave that's amazing what about drinks \nwell karen and i will buy some canned tea like usual i prefer apple juice so i'm going to get \na bottle of it what about you paula oh i'm very simple just a plain bottle \nof water is enough for me all right that's everything we need to get isn't it \nyes i wrote all of them down now let's go or we're going to be late [Music] \nsadie what time is it it's 10 20 already oh then we still have quite a while \npaula can you check with your list to see if we've had everything i'm on it \nnow let's choose some decorations for the picture wait i have two pieces of picnic cloths \none is the normal red and white checkered pattern one is pastel purple with tiny white \nflowers which one do you prefer let's choose the pastel purple it looks \nmore simple i agree we bring a lot of things so when we set them out on top of the checkered pattern \nthe whole picture might look too complicated all right hannah would you fold this and \nput it in the basket for me sure by the way do you still have the fake \ntulip bouquet that's in the present box your mom gave you last christmas yeah it's on my bookshelf why do you ask \ni was thinking that it could be a nice decoration the flowers were also purple and the \nwhite wrapping paper would look amazing on this cloth that's actually a good idea \nwait a minute let me go get it ah can you bring your speaker too i want to play some music i even made a \nplaylist already of course paula did you bring the mirror that i \nasked for oh right here it is wow it is the perfect size thank you \nthis is going to look pretty hey do you think we can fit all the fruit in this bowl \ni don't think so we need two bowls one for the grapes and one for the strawberries and blueberries \nokay karen can you reach the top shelf the glasses are up there sure wait a minute \nhere are the speaker and tulip bouquet i already put them in a separate bag \nall right should we microwave the rules that your mom made okay let me do it \nhey where should i put these glasses in the brown box in that drawer then you can put it in the bag that has the \nspeaker and the bouquet well now we're all done let's go guys \nbefore the sun gets too harsh [Music] \nthanks for
