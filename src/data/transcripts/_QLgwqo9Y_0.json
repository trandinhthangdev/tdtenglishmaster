celebrating it this \nyear \nis valentine's day big in england \ni haven't lived in england for a while \nnow \nabout 10 years \nwhen i was a kid it was a big deal in \nschool like \nin junior school \nand we used to have a little valentine's \npost box in our class when we could \nwrite \nlittle messages to our classmates and \nthen you put it in the box and it'd get \ndelivered \noh in a box \nyeah in a little valentine's post box \noh cool \nthe teacher would deliver them \ndid you only get notes or did you get \ncandy as well \nno \nit was just notes \nin england we don't really give candy \nand chocolate and presents to people \nwe just give letters \nunless it's like a boyfriend or a \ngirlfriend or something \nbut when i am seven i don't really \nbother \nwell \nthe thing i liked about valentine's day \nas a kid was that you'd get valentine's \nday cards from everyone \nbut \ni was always curious to see what the boy \ni liked wrote to me \ndo you know who \nwrote what to you \nyeah \nthey would sign their name on the card \nwhat they signed names \nyeah it'd be like \nhappy valentine's day \noh in england i don't think you \nput your name \neven if you know who it's from you know \nit's from your girlfriend or your best \nfriend or your grandma or something \ni think you just \nput a big question mark \nreally \nit's half the fun you have to figure it \nout \nbut my favorite valentine's day gift is \nalways from my mom \nshe gives you a gift every year \nshe'll send me gifts in the mail \nand when i was in elementary school she \nwould hide chocolates and stuff in my \ndesk it was awesome \nthat's brilliant \nyeah \ni don't remember getting any really \nreally cool valentine's presents \ni remember giving a couple i was dating \na girl who lived in norway when i was at \nuniversity in england \nand so for valentine's day \nis the same \ni think her birthday was february the \n11th or something \nso i just flew over i emailed her best \nfriend who i knew quite well as well \nand he picked me up at the airport and \nflew over to norway \nyeah \nand in norway it's a very safe country \nso they don't really lock their doors a \nbit like japan \nand he just drove me down to the house \nand i walked in at like nine in the \nmorning \nand she just came downstairs and she \nnearly died she thought i was a ghost \nyeah \nthat would be scary but fun \nscary but fun \nthat's what she said when she could talk \nyeah \nso it was a double birthday valentine's \nday gift \nexactly \n[Music] \nthanks for watching \ndon't forget to like share
