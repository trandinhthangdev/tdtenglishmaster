working as a chef at restaurant downtown what is your \njob i'm currently an english teacher working for boston high school in new york \noh that's great why did you choose that job i was previously a lawyer and found it \nto be stressful and never had any free time so after quitting that job i thought \nteaching might be not as stressful and more time off was teaching your passion \nyes since i was a child but my family directed me to study law and now that i'm older i found out what \ni really wanted i remember cooking is also your passion right yes but lucky for me my family supports \nmy dream in my career do you enjoy your job most of the time it's very rewarding to \nbe able to help people every day and the students here are very hardworking and fun to teach \nworking at a restaurant is exhausting but people are so nice to me do you get on well with your co-workers \nyes fine i don't really see work as a part of my social life so i don't socialize with them i think it's more \nprofessional to be that way what was your first day like there were lots of teachers starting at \nthe same time as me so we all had a big induction day the senior teachers ran workshops with \nus to familiarize us with the systems they had and then we went for a work team \ndinner in the evening my first day at work was like any other day at the restaurant i started working \nright away and i have a supervisor to help me with the work it was scary at first with \nresponsibilities do you have at work all of the teachers main responsibility \nis to plan good lessons and then teach them on top of that we have several admin \ntasks like mark homework fill out attendance sheets and right report \ni'm on the dessert part of the kitchen staff team so i have to prepare fruits baking cakes all day \nbut i love my job would you change your job in the future \nyes i like working by myself so i would like to be my own boss \ni want to open my restaurant what is your typical day like at work \ni start the day by doing all the planning at home before going to work around three to print off my materials \nand then i teach all evening what would you change about your job \ni would like to have more freedom to teach outside the syllabus i get it at the restaurant they want me \nto follow the recipes but i want to put my ideas into baking what is the most important part of your \nwork i think that dealing with customers will be the most important part of my work \ni learned to be polite and keep smiling even with some of the more challenging customers \ni know i have to deal with some tough students parents and some stubborn kids but most of the time the kids are nice \nit's great seeing you doing what you love i'm so happy for you \nthank you me too and good luck with your dream plan thanks \n[Music] \nFirst Day of Work \nhey nick it's dave hey what's up tomorrow is my first day of work at \nglobal complex and i need some advice on how to make the best first impression \nyour first day of work is very important it's foundational and sets a good start for your job going forward \nhow is the first day of work often like the first day is typically when you'll \nsee your work area learn your workflow and schedule meet your co-workers get \nfamiliar with different areas of your office or building do i have to dress up \nyes dress up to make a good impression ensure you're meeting the company's dress code if everyone around you is \ndressed more casually you can adjust your clothing choices in later days \nhow early should i go rush hour traffic could make your mute take longer than a typical trip to the \nsame area and showing up for your job early is much better than being late \nare there any important documents that i should pay attention to you need to review employment contracts \nand take care of paperwork such as tax forms your new employer's health insurance coverage retirement plans vacation \npolicy i don't know if i should ask many questions \nasking questions now will help you avoid mistakes in the future being inquisitive also shows that you \nwant to do well in your new position okay and should i make friends at work \nmaking friends will encourage your co-workers to think of you as one of the team a good friend could also help you \nadvance your career how should i do it smile be cheerful and introduce yourself \nto as many of your new co-workers as you can during breaks start conversations by \nasking which restaurants or coffee shops are nearby i can do that \nand eating lunch is a great way to make friends and find out more about the people you'll be working with \ni will make friends with people who can help me most i can get useful advice about how to \nsucceed at my new job that's a good idea learning from the right co-workers is \nimportant you should listen to people's conversations carefully and watch their behavior \nokay i will do that remember to pay attention to your body language sit or stand up straight to \navoid signs of nervousness or boredom such as touching your hair tapping your foot or yawning \ni will have a supervisor i'm so nervous around the boss if your supervisor sends you an email or \ntells you to come to their office respond immediately this demonstrates both respect and enthusiasm \nokay but what if i made a mistake most employers understand if you make a few minor mistakes on your first day of \nwork remember that you'll have a chance to do better tomorrow okay is that all \nthe last thing is saying goodbye when you leave thank your supervisor for hiring you \nand let them know that you enjoyed the first day what if they feel talkative what should \ni say i'm so shy you can talk to them about your day and how you plan to handle future projects \nwish them a good night and tell them that you look forward to seeing them tomorrow okay thank you for your help you make me \nfeel less worried no problem text me if you need any help thanks \n[Music]

of a situation here my five-year-old son doesn't like \nfruit or any kind of vegetable how do you teach your kids to eat \nhealthy food you should make an effort to incorporate a range of fruits and vegetables of \ndifferent hues into their diet make eating colorful \nthat's a great idea you should teach him healthy habits slowly every day kids pick up your \nhabits too both good and bad what should i start with \nmake half your meals fruits and vegetables and don't worry if he doesn't start eating yet keep serving balanced meals \nokay and i'm worried that his habit of eating ice cream may cause some health problems \nreduce added sugars added sugar has been linked to childhood obesity chronic diseases behavior \nproblems and more how should i do that drink water \nkids don't need sweetened drinks what kind of protein you would need \nseafood poultry lean beef eggs dairy beans peas nuts and seeds are all good protein \nsources to include in a child's diet okay is any other food good for babies \nwhole wheat brown rice oatmeal and even popcorn are all whole grain foods that \ndeliver fiber and b vitamins in addition to an energy boost \nbut many healthy foods like whole grain bread and peanut butter are processed should i avoid it \nno but do try to limit highly processed foods which include artificial dyes \npreservatives refined fats and flowers and added sugars \nokay i will try to cook from scratch using whole ingredients \ntrust me i have four kids at a young age they all need our guide to form a \nhealthy lifestyle can you help me please this is my first kid and i'm kinda lost \nsure start with limited screen time children are growing up immersed in the \ndigital world and parents play an important role in teaching their children how to use screen time \nhealthily but my kid likes watching tv \nmake your own family media use plan set limits overuse of media can lead to a sedentary \nlifestyle and displace important social interactions exercise and even sleep \nshould i make him play outside what if he doesn't like playing sports \nif he sees you being active and finds physical activities he enjoys staying healthy and active becomes easy \nexpose him to a range of physical activities like swimming archery or gymnastics \nhe is bound to find something he enjoys he is still a kid \nshould i start teaching him how to read developing strong reading skills is an \nessential component of your child's success in school now and at work later in life \nreally yes reading helps build a child's self-esteem relationships with parents \nand others and success later in life okay i will make sure reading is a part \nof his playtime and bedtime routines doctors suggest that daily reading to \nchildren can begin as early as six months of age how can i make reading interesting for \nhim choose books your kid likes so that he views reading as a treat rather than a \nchore i will set up play dates for him with activities like reading and playing at \nthe park hmm yes good idea \nfriendships are very important playing with friends teaches kids valuable social skills such as communication \ncooperation and problem solving great there are many kids in our \nneighborhood i will find kids his age encourage your kid to develop a variety \nof friendships and to play with friends often it will set him up with life skills he \ncan

i've been wanting to talk to you \noh hi amy what's up the thing is i admire your healthy body \nand i want your advice on having a better healthier lifestyle \nsure that's great a healthy person eats a balanced diet drinks adequate water and does the right \namount of exercise but i'm busy with work and family \ni think people who live healthfully always have one thing in common they manage to strike a balance between work \nand life between exercise and diet what's your secret to achieving that \ngoal even when you're too busy try to do some exercise or have some entertainment \nyou don't need to go to the gym and spend two hours doing physical activities \nmaybe i will have a small break from work and do some stretching exercises \nyes try not to sit too much nowadays societies are built in such a way that they are ideal for healthy \nliving yes in my neighborhood we have plenty of greenery a gym park swimming pools etc \nyes you can go for a morning walk work out in the gym and start your day \nin the evenings you can spend time in the parks okay and i can bring my kids and they \nwill have these healthy habits and diet is also very important \nhow important more important than we would probably ever know \nafter all it is the balanced diet that keeps nourishing each and every cell of our body by providing a variety of \nnutrition from the different food groups but what is a balanced diet \nspecifically vegetables and fruits protein like meat fish eggs beans soy \ndairies like low-fat milk cheese yogurt carbohydrates like rice pasta potatoes \nand bread and a small number of healthy fats wow i didn't think much about the food i \nconsume i don't know it's pretty complicated anyway \na balanced diet is important for maintaining a healthy lifestyle because it provides all kinds of \nimportant vitamins minerals and nutrients to keep the body and mind strong and healthy \ni will try to cook balanced and clean meals for my family i know food can be very tempting but try \nto stick to healthy food food that you know is hygienic and carefully prepared \nso i have to cut down the pizzas and hot dogs and tacos \nno once in a while we can give ourselves a nice little treat like the cheese pizza i had yesterday \nokay i will try drink a lot of water too cut down on sugary drinks and caffeine \ni will ensure that i eat a nutritious diet and have a water bottle on my table \ngood stick to all of those rules and your health will be much better \nthank you so much i will try to turn it into habits \ngood luck [Music] \nthanks for watching don't forget
