roasted salmon for the main course \nand for side dishes how about the mashed potato garlic bread and chicken nuggets sure \nthat sounds nice how do i make teriyaki beef all it has is rice and teriyaki beef \nthat sounds easy but how do i make it first you need to make some white rice \nthen what do i do then you need to shred some beef and marinate it with teriyaki \nsauce then you cook it and eat it okay i got it and how do you plan on cooking the cream \npasta do you want to make pasta i got this new recipe for basic egg pasta and it's quite easy oh cool \nbut i forgot to buy flour don't worry i brought a flour enough to make pasta \nfor two first whip together the flour and salt with a fork in a mixing bowl \ncrack the eggs into the middle of the bowl okay shall i whisk the eggs \nyes whisk until it starts forming a very soft dough then gently folding the dough on \nitself flattening and folding again it will be extremely soft at first \nthen gradually start to firm up okay it is firm enough to knead now \nbegin kneading the dough slice into the dough with a paring knife \nflatten one piece of dough and feed it through the pasta roller \nokay i feed it through a couple of times it's smooth enough to cut now okay \nwe will switch to the noodle cutter and run the sheet of pasta through the cutter \nand we have the fresh egg pasta homemade okay now let's make the sauce i will \nshare my sauce making with you first you heat olive in a medium pan over medium heat \nchop garlic then add into the pan and stir until fragrant one to two minutes \nokay shall i add butter yes and stir constantly until melted \nthen pour in chicken broth then add pepper and salt okay it's boiling shall i add the pasta \nyes and stir heavy cream and parsley into the pasta then grate the parmesan cheese and mix \nthoroughly okay all done \nthat smells good well done thanks and our last main dish is grilled salmon \nokay would you mind preheating the oven to 450 degrees fahrenheit \nplease i will season the salmon with salt and pepper \n[Music] add some cheese and squeeze in a couple of drops of lemon juice \nokay ready now place salmon skin side down \nhow long do i set the cooking timer grill until salmon is cooked through about 12 \nto 15 minutes okay the main dishes are ready now let's \nmove to the side dishes can you tell me how to do your famous delicious chicken nuggets \noh it's easy i will season the chicken with garlic salt and pepper then coat it with flour then you prepare \nthe bread crumbs i will season it with salt and pepper \nokay then whisk the egg and water in a bowl then dip the chicken in the egg mixture \nthen bread crumbs gently pressing the crumbs into the chicken \nok the chicken is coated well then heat the vegetable oil in a large \nfrying pan over medium-high heat add the chicken pieces to the pan and \nfry until it turns brown on each side okay \ndone great and the big secret is to sprinkle the nuggets with a little bit \nof salt while it is hot and sir oh that is very nice \nwhere did you get the recipe from i have a cookbook please help me with the presentation of \nthe dish here take this plate in tissues lay the tissues on the plate and then put the \nnuggets on the plate please pass me that tomato sauce bottle \nit will enhance its taste good idea do you want to know it's recipe \nof course it's very tasty it's also very cheap easy and fast to cook \ni'm giving you a cd of this recipe i hope that you will try it well i shall try it on sunday and now we \nshould finish our side dishes before we move to make dessert okay peel those potatoes then place \npotatoes and water to cover in a large saucepan bring to a boil \nreduce heat cook until tender okay what's next drain return to pan \nmash potatoes to to desired consistency stir in add salt and heavy cream if you \nlike it creamy yes can i add a little garlic sure \noh it smells nice okay mashed potatoes are ready \nnow for the garlic bread since the bread then diced the garlic into small pieces and \nmix it with butter and spread it on the bread and place it in the oven and bake for five minutes all done \nso what should we do for dessert let's make chocolate brownies i'm really good at this but we don't \nhave much time left to make brownies what if i told you that you don't need to melt chocolate or chocolate chips \njust one bowl in five minutes bringing it all together to make the best brownies you've ever \neaten really is that possible yes the best part is they're only 144 \ncalories each wow tell me how to do it \nevery step is the same but the one ingredient i add these brownies that is different from most recipes \nis a small amount of oil once you have all the ingredients mix them all then \nbake for 10 minutes [Music] \nokay the dessert will be ready just in time great i think everything is ready shall \nwe sit yes come on let's eat oh everything looks so good cooking is \nquite tiring but it is so

our company what can you do that differentiates you from other applicants \ni noticed from your job description that you are looking for someone with a unique perspective \ngiven my background of multiple years living abroad i believe i would be suitable for this \njob very interesting is there anything you dislike about this job \nor our company not much but i do have to say the lack of an \nefficient communication channel is worrying but i can definitely help with that too \ni agree that can be very useful tell me how do you define success as a \nsoftware developer i think of software

cooking class i took a piano class too i can play \npiano and sing a few songs that's amazing i can teach you how to \nswim and can you teach me to play a song sure [Music] \ndialogue five two friends mike and susan talk about their favorite \nseason it's so hot today \ni agree it's so hot you could fry an egg on the sidewalk \ni prefer summer over winter i can't stand the cold weather i think cold weather is more comfortable \nthan this boiling hot weather but in the summer you can do so many fun activities \nlike what you can go to the beach sunbathing swimming boating water ski \ngo to the water parks hiking camping barbecuing eating ice cream \nplaying sports outside gardening bicycling go on a picnic that's right there are so \nmany activities to do at the beach yes you can surf dive windsurf playing \nbeach volleyball snorkel go on a canoe \nwell maybe summer is more fun i will try to do it this summer \ndialogue 6 talk about summer weather what is the weather like \nhow it affects my life it's boiling hot today \ni think this summer will be uncomfortable i love to tan on holiday and come back \nlooking sun-kissed how about you do you like summer \nactually no we've predicted that summer temperatures will be hotter than normal \nthat's bad i want to be enjoying the outdoors \nand i just want to stay in my room with the ac on try and stay out of the sun at midday \nwhen it's the strongest the hot weather makes me sweat a lot and \nexhausted you can take a short break to go on a trip to avoid the heat \nluckily august will be good weather for outdoor activities although are temperatures near or above \nnormal that's good you can go to the beach in relax \nor do some activities outside like camping or swimming \ni will try to go out this summer [Music] \nhometown [Music] so john where are you from \ni guess my hometown is not too big it's a little town in the countryside in \nnorthampton there are only 10 000 people there \nso it is very quiet in my hometown i do not really like it wow \nthere aren't very many people no it's very small \nis there anywhere to go in your town there aren't very many businesses there \nisn't a shopping mall there are a lot of grocery stores and \nthere are a lot of gas stations but there isn't much to do there \noh really are there any movie theaters well there is one movie theater so \nthat's a nice thing to do is the movie theater good or bad \nin fact there are many screens in this video there are eight different movies showing \nhow about at night what do you want to ask about \nwhat's fun to do how about at night is there very much nightlife \nyeah there is not so much but there is a bowling alley \nthere is a bowling alley and a movie theater anything more to do there is one \nrestaurant where you can go for tacos and burritos and there's one more restaurant for \npizza and spaghetti um that must be boring \nbut during the day time you can go to the park what's inside the park there's a river \nthat goes through the town so in the middle of town there's a river \nand there's a park that goes along both sides of the river and at the park there is a tennis court \nand a disc golf course disco golf yeah i like to play disc golf \nwith my friends it's really fun and after we finish playing disc golf we usually go to the \npizza restaurant oh i see how about schools are there \nvery many schools let's see no there aren't very many \nthere's only one elementary school one junior high school and one high school that's it \ninteresting yeah there aren't very many schools but the town doesn't need \nmore schools because there aren't very many people there \ni see are there any mountains no the whole area is a very flat there \nare no mountains but there are a lot of trees in fact there are trees on my town's \nsign because my town is famous for all the trees on every street \noh wow sounds like a great city so harley as i understand you live in \ncroatia where are you from what do you like and dislike about your place \nyes i live in croatia in a city named fula where is the city actually \nit is situated in the israelian peninsula and it's the biggest city in istria it counts a population \nof around 60 000 and do you like it what i like about \nhula is the fact that it's perfectly sized it's not too big nor too small and it \nhas all of the civilization benefits as any western european city \nthat's good though for example in the area of education and culture \nthere is a university a theater a cinema a great number of \ngalleries museums libraries there are some historical sites and so on \nthen for example in the health area there is a hospital a number of private clinics dentist \noffices ambulances and pharmacies and so on \nwhat about places for entertainment there are places to go such as \nrestaurants bars exhibitions concerts especially in the \nsummer during various festivals sports gastronomics musicals dances and theatrical events \nwow that sounds interesting also pula is surrounded by the adriatic \nsea so you can always go to the beach or to one of the many beaches to sunbathe or go fishing or sailing \nreally i really like living near the sea if you prefer the land you can take a \nfield trip to the surrounding places and discover their natural and other attractions \nall together i really love living there okay you only told me about your \npositive sides of living in pula what about your dislikes \nwell like any other place there is no perfection the downside is that we have a huge \ntraffic problem i would say especially lately due to some construction projects \nthat sounds uncomfortable so i recommend using public transportation whenever possible \nor simply going on foot some people might say that pula doesn't exactly have a wild nightlife but i don't consider it \na downside rather a peaceful alternative to some other tourist destinations \nso that's it would you prefer to live somewhere else \nto be honest i'm not kind of a city person and i am quite fed up with the traffic \njam in the city so if i were to live somewhere else it would have to be somewhere off the \nbeaten track to escape the hustle and bustle of city life that way i can be closer to nature and \nsoak up fresh air every morning most people in this world do not live in \ntheir home towns why well i guess the majority of people \nfeel that there could be more opportunities outside of their hometowns and consequently comfort zones \ntherefore many believe that living in such a comfortable place with relatives and friends can be \ndistracting and too relaxing on the way of pursuing goals \nthey might go abroad as well right yes people not only youth strive to \nexplore other places and experience different cultures across the globe \nwhich affects a person's personality more the hometown of the current city why \nhometown defines how a person behaves and the current city defines how a person wants to change \ni think that the hometown has a much greater impact on a person than the current city \nokay thanks harley thank you \nthe passive voice jaden is being interviewed by jessica \nfor the new post on the school website \noh hi nice to meet you pleased to meet you here how are you \ndoing today i'm great what about you \ni'm good too okay jaden let's start our talk today can you \nintroduce a little bit about yourself yeah of course my name is jaden \nthomas i'm a student at brookhill high school i was born in 2004 in birmingham \nin birmingham so why did you move to this city \njust because my house was built near our school and it is also said to be one of the best schools in england \nso yeah i moved here when i was six years old what made you decide to choose this \nschool firstly i think i'm taken care of by all the college staff when i study here \nthat's great who is your best teacher in this school \nit's hard to choose the best but i would say it is mrs johnstone \nis she a chemistry teacher yeah i have been learning a lot from her and \nshe is friendly as well last winter i was invited to her \nchristmas party with her family wow has she been told that you got the \nfirst prize not yet i phoned her but she didn't answer \ni'm going to meet her tomorrow at school probably she will be so proud of you \ni hope so i think she expected a lot and i didn't want to disappoint her as well \nokay so let's talk about your study how did you prepare for this competition \ni'm lucky that i was given many useful books from teachers and students who already joined to the test \nso you were revising a lot for the preparation weren't you yes and i was tested \nevery week by my teachers so i knew what i needed to improve \nyou are hard-working though do you have any special suggestions to \nprepare for the exam i think when i had to memorize something \ni usually wrote songs about that wow \ncan you sing or play musical instruments i can play piano a little bit \nthe songs are kind of silly but it made me feel less stressed when i studied \n[Music] you must perform one day at school i will try to practice more one day \nthank you so how did your parents feel when you won \nyou might think that they would be very excited yes of course you did it so well \nyeah but they only told me that i was just luckier than other students oh \nreally that sounds strange yeah they said that because my parents \ndidn't want me to be overconfident did your family do anything to celebrate \nyour win yeah we are planning but i guess we will do it on the weekend \nwhat will you do for the celebration perhaps we will have a lovely dinner at \na restaurant wow so what about you \nhow did you feel i'm really surprised i just wanted to \nget the prize because it can be used when i apply to university what are you going to \nstudy at university i'm considering between material science \nand chemistry do you have any dream universities \neveryone wants to go to cambridge so do i but it is really difficult but you are \nalso excellent our school is so lucky to have you \nno i am so normal i still need to try my best to get my dream university \nwell good luck to you i hope i can have a talk again with you when you are accepted by cambridge university \ni wish that too thank you so much [Music] \nwinship and lewis just went back home after work and saw all the doors and \nwindows of their house opened what's that \nwhat's going on did you forget to lock the door no you locked it i even checked it twice \n[Music] the windows on the second floor are opened as well \ndid you see if anything disappeared not really let me check again \nit's so strange the flowers on the balcony were watered \nare you sure no way the robber watered you can come here to check they're all \nwet and some chairs were moved did you check your working space has \nyour computer been stolen no i don't think there was a robber \nso someone came

hire any housekeepers today \nand then you forgot i never call them on weekdays \nand they told me they can't come this month as well maybe they changed the plan but you \nforgot let me check the

bring a mini refrigerator okay do you have an idea of the kind of \ndorm decor you want what is your style i'm in the funky retro style \ni want to hang up posters of rock bands and some famous artists i like rock music too do you want to \ncoordinate dorm decor great decorate the room together will be \nso much fun and what are your thoughts on chores \nwe will split the chores equally according to our study schedule \nmost of my classes are in the morning so i will do the chores at noon \ngreat and when i get back at night i'll do the rest how do you feel about guests and \nsocializing in the dorm i have a girlfriend if you're okay with \nit you'll hang out in our room occasionally sure i'm cool with that just tell me \nbefore she gets here thank you for understanding are you \ntaking any extracurriculars or playing sports on campus i'm currently in the environmental club \ni'm planning on joining the soccer team do you play soccer \ni like watching football but i don't play what do you do in your spare time do you \nwatch tv shows together sure i want to apply for a part-time job in my spare time \nit'd be fun to go together it's a good idea it's a good opportunity to have more \nexperiences are you planning on going home a lot \ni only trot back to my parents house for the holidays i want to go home every weekend so you \ncan invite your friends over on the weekend great and how do you like to study \ni like listening to music when i study do you mind i like studying in silence but it's okay \nwe can schedule our study time differently or i can go to the university library \nokay and what are you planning to do over summer break i don't have any plan yet how about you \ni will go to the beach to my friend's party you can come with me if you want \nthat sounds fun we need to relax after this semester that's right we'll have so much fun \nliving together i'm so excited to start our university life together \n[Music] situation two lucas comes back home from \ncollege and his little brother mike wants his advice on living with roommates \nhi lucas welcome home i missed you hey mike i missed you too have you been \ngood to mom and dad yes i have and i'm so excited for you to \ncome home for this summer holiday tell me everything about your college \nlife is it fun do you have a roommate \nit's fun but also tough i have a roommate but i don't like him \nhave so much trouble living together really why he is slobby and unorganized \nwe just can't get along we have nothing in common and his annoying behaviors are driving \nme crazy how bad is he for example \nit's one thing to leave his shoes and socks on his bedroom floor \nthat is his own private space after all but don't be a slob in shared spaces \nlike the kitchen or living room that's so rude did you guys agree to \nshare the house chores yes but we agreed to pick up after yourself and he still lives \ndishes in the sink leaves dirty pots and pans on the stove \ndoesn't put away leftovers do you guys share the bathroom \nyes and he leaves his dirty clothes or towels in the bathroom \ntoothpaste splatter in the sink or on the bathroom mirror all the time i guess you guys fight a \nlot right yes he doesn't respect my schedule \ni have an 8 am class every day but sometimes he comes home at 2 a.m banging the door or sets up the alarm at \n7am but never gets up to turn it off i see what are his personalities \nhe is needy he depends on me for a social life and even all his emotional support \nif he doesn't have other people he can count on or any other ways to help himself \nthat can be exhausting and overwhelming for me you can set up some limits to when you \ntalk to him and how long you will be around him trust me you feel \nso much better he is also an attention seeker he will do \nanything for attention including talking about me behind my back \nsharing my personal information with others you should let him know his \nbehavior is causing a rift hopefully he'll hear you out and reevaluate his actions \ni hope so roommates can be lifelong friends but they can be a nightmare \nso what will you do when you go back to your dorm people usually think moving rooms or \nchanging roommates will be the magic solution to all their problems but learning how to deal with situations \nyou have with your roommate can benefit you your entire life \ni think roommate problems are caused by miscommunications and the problem can be solved just by \nsitting down with a neutral friend and talking things out you are going to college next year \nremember don't let yourself be a bad roommate and notice bad signs from your roomie soon \nshould i share the dorm room with anyone or live alone it's nice to have someone who can wake \nyou when you sleep through your alarm or bring you soup when you're sick they might introduce you to a different \nculture or new point of view i may have a roommate who likes to do the same things as i do \nbut you may not have the privacy you're used to and may have to seek out places \nlike the library to get it if your roommate's habits personality or \nschedule are very different from yours it can be hard to adjust to living together \nthat's true so what should i do to live harmoniously with my roommate \ncommunicating often and openly is essential for any successful relationship \nmake rules and respect them for example you guys agree that if one of them is \ntrying to study the other won't blare music or will record tv shows to watch later \nwhat if we don't agree on something you'll both have to make some compromises \nif you behave politely to your roommate your roommate is likely to follow your lead \nthanks for your advice and good luck with your roommate thanks i hope i can work it out \ngreetings leila moved to the dormitory of her \nuniversity in her room there are anna amanda \nand kim living there before her hello i'm leila hello laila \nmy name is amanda this
