the \nemployer now imagine I am an interviewer and you will answer my questions tell me about \nyourself my name is John Anderson I'm 22 years \nold um sorry I don't know what to \nsay that's okay right now is just practice but when you interview you \ncan't answer uncertainly like this when you introduce yourself you need to introduce your name age the \nuniversity you have attended and the orientation of yourself what do you mean when you say \nthe orientation of myself orientation of yourself means what your career goals are in the \nfuture you can tell employers what you're passionate about and why oh I see \nwhat they want to know about is my orientation at work can you wait a \nmoment for me to take notes sure take your \ntime okay what's next the next question they may ask is why are you applying for \nthis position how would you answer this question because I really like this \njob this is my dream job and the salary is pretty high no you shouldn't answer like that \nyou should avoid the answer like I just really need a job or I need money why is that \nso because when the employer asks this question what they really want to know is how much you know about their

that you are a good fit let them know that their values are aligned with your \nvalues extremely useful thank you for letting me know you're welcome and the \nother most common question the employer will ask you in a job interview is why are you a good fit for this \nposition I think because my major was marketing quite suitable for this \nposition to answer this question you should talk about your work experience but I haven't worked anywhere \nwhat can I put on experience you can talk about the experiences and activities you've had at \nUniversity related to this job is it okay to say that the employer asks this question \nbecause they want to make sure that you can do the job as long as you show that you have skills qualified for the job \nthat would be fine okay I'll keep this in mind mind what else in most job interviews \ncandidates will be asked to describe their strengths and weaknesses let's think about that what \nare your strengths and weaknesses how should I answer the question your strengths and weaknesses \nshould reflect the requirements of the job the strengths are the opportunity \nfor you to express more about yourself and weaknesses are areas you \nneed to improve on but don't let your weaknesses sound like they will impede your \nperformance so that's how it is now I know how to answer those \nquestions thanks for your advice you have saved my life you're welcome these \nare some common questions you often answer when interviewing to have a better answer you \nshould carefully research the company and the job position you apply for the most important thing is to show \nthe employer your good attitude and confidence when interviewing I have known it carefully \nand feel more confident now thank you so much good luck with the interview

the same time doing a lot \nof different activities at University specifically I volunteered \nwas part of the student council I'm part of the managing team of the design marketing Club what are your \nweaknesses I think my weakness is that I I tend to be overly critical of \nmyself when I complete a project I always feel that I could have done better even though the response I \nreceive is

English learning \nchannel in this video we'll explore the Essential Elements of easing an interview including how to answer common \ninterview questions and common mistakes that you should know how to avoid during the \nprocess let's get started it was one fine morning Tom was sitting \noutside of the interview room Tom was excitedly waiting for his \nturn to interview for the job he had long desired a software \ndeveloper the company had an amazing reputation in the field Tom was so eager for the \ninterview until well well well look who's here \nisn't this Tom Tom the Airhead hi \nDerek oh Tom I can't believe they even considered you for this role software \ndevelopment requires real skills you know are you sure that you're in the \nright place don't get your hopes up this position is \nmine remember who you are you are nobody you should stand up and go home \nnow Tom didn't want to argue with with Derek but deep down he felt \nuncomfortable the interviewer opened the door and called the next person Derek quickly stood up while Tom \nwas sitting still as if in a trance Derek whispered in Tom's \near just stay out of my way loser then Derek headed into the \ninterview room leaving Tom behind with his thoughts at a fleeting moment Tom found \nhim self immersed in the memories of days gone \nby Tom endured Derek's teasing throughout high [Music] \nschool he remembered every moment when Derek made him feel small and \ninsignificant causing him to lose confidence Tom had an incredibly tough \ntime during those years it took a long time for him to overcome the insecurity ities that \nDerrik had caused just when Tom started feeling \nmore confident in himself he encountered Derek again that same voice that same attitude \nhaunted Tom once more just as Tom was immersed in these thoughts he was suddenly called for the \ninterview entering the room he was so nervous and worried this made him \nstumble and feel empty-headed good afternoon Tom thank you for coming \nin today I'm Cindy and I'll be conducting your interview today can you tell me a \nlittle about yourself uh sure \nwell my name's Tom I've worked in a few different \nplaces and you know learn some stuff along the \nway okay what do you know about our company I \nknow this is a big company could you give me some details \nabout your previous work experience yeah uh I've done a bit of \nthis and that tasks and stuff how do you handle working in a \nteam and resolving conflicts teamwork is important and \nconflicts I guess I try to talk it out and stuff what is your greatest \nstrength I'm a quick learner um why should we hire you for this \njob I know I can do a great job in this role okay where do you see yourself in 5 \nyears honestly I'm not so sure sure I guess I'll figure it out as time goes \non do you have any questions for me um \nno no thank you for sharing Tom we will consider all candidates and get in touch \n[Music] later a few days later Tom was informed \nthat he had not met their expectations for the position Cindy expressed to Tom that he could try \nagain in the future and what made Tom even sadder was when he found out that Derek got the \nposition with a heavy heart Tom went to his girlfriend to find some \ncomfort Tom was sitting on his girlfriend's sofa all he needed right then was some comfort and a \nhug Linda his girlfriend came and sat next to him her are you \nokay I didn't get the job seriously Tom what \nhappened that guy who used to bully me in high school got it you mean \nDerek yes you must have messed something \nup and Derek he must have handled it better Linda I thought you'd be here for \nme I'm just saying you should be as strong and confident as \nDerek it hurts you're just criticizing and comparing \nme whatever Tom it's the truth I'm tired of disappointment I need \ntime to think about us don't contact me during this \ntime wait Linda you can't do this to me \nI need to go now you should go home and have some sleep or whatever you want to \n[Music] \ndo with a shattered heart Tom walked into a bar he ordered a strong \n[Music] cocktail as Tom was enjoying his drink he noticed a girl approaching him \nit was Cindy the person who had interviewed him Tom isn't \nit yeah it's me hi Cindy do you know why I remember \nyou because I was a loser no you seem really capable your \nexperience and background were good but the way you answered the \nquestions seemed so weird and amateur what's wrong Tom told Cindy what happened that \nday he confided in Cindy like two friends and told Cindy how much he loved the job as a software \ndeveloper I wanted to be honest with you about your interview your knowledge is solid but your confidence seemed to \nwaver you struggled with answering questions yeah I know I was really \nnervous hi understand but I believe in your potential let me share something with \nyou what is it I had really HED that you would be the one who got the job that \nday oh really why is that well when it comes to Derek he's \nquite arrogant I mean he does have some skills but his \nattitude so I had some expectations for you that day I'm sorry I feel like I let you \ndown oh no that's not what I meant what I saw during the interview \ndoesn't Define you what should I do now you have to work on your confidence \nand communication don't let external pressures determine your self- \nworner it's just hard you know I've always been a bit insecure \nI get it but you can't live according to others [Music] feelings you've been too easily \ninfluenced by others opinions you need to take charge of your own \nlife you're right I need to change that you absolutely can start by \nbelieving in yourself focus on personal growth develop your skills work on your \ncommunication and gradually the confidence will follow thanks \nCindy good things will come your way when you're invested in your own \nprogress your words mean a lot to me you've got this Tom remember success \ncomes from within Tom took a deep breath feeling a \nsense of connection with Cindy's words he found himself opening up further about his \ndreams and the lessons he had learned from this \nfailure after Sydney's encouragement Tom felt a strong urge to \nchange he decided to begin trying harder and learning the skills required for a successful \ninterview he practiced his answers improved his communication and boosted \nhis self-confidence as he progressed he felt more and more confident \nwith determination Tom applied for the same position at the company where he had faced \ndisappointment on the way to the interview as Tom approached the company building he unexpectedly encountered \nDerek and Linda standing outside look who decided to show up \nagain it's our Superstar L \nLinda what surprised huh I'm only going with who is truly \ndeserving that's right this is how it should be you're trying again good luck with \nthat hey maybe they're hiring for a clown position he'd be \nperfect Derek and Linda walked away leaving behind a mocking \nlaughter Tom had mentally prepared to meet Derek but he never expected to see Linda with him like that she left Tom to \ngo with Derek Tom stood there Frozen for a \nmoment but then he remembered what Cindy said he took a deep breath and put \neverything aside he headed straight into the company \nbuilding he only had one thought on his mind now he must get the \njob [Music] good morning Tom good to see you \nagain hi Cindy nice to see you are you \nready yes I'm ready okay can you tell me a bit about \nyour background I've been working as a software developer for the past 5 \nyears I have experience with various programming languages like python Java \nand JavaScript I've also worked on both front-end and backend development \nprojects great it sounds like you have a good range of skills how did you hear \nabout this position I actually came across the job posting on your company's website while \nI was searching for software developer positions what do you consider to be \nyour greatest strength I believe my attention to detail is one of my greatest strengths \nI'm thorough in my work and I make sure to catch even the smallest errors in my code which helps \nin creating high quality software great Tom how about handling \npressure or stressful situations when things get stressful I \ntend to stay calm I break down the problem into smaller steps I also share \nconcerns and collaborate on Solutions with my team good approach Tom what did you do \nin the last year to improve your knowledge over the past year I've been \ntaking some online courses to improve my skills I also took part in coding \nchallenges to challenge myself and learn from others in the coding \nCommunity continuous learning is important moving on what are your salary \nexpectations for this position based on my skills and \nexperience and on the current industry rates I'm looking at a salary of around \n$8,800 per month that sounds reasonable Tom now I \nwant to know more about your expertise \n[Music] sure cheers \n[Music] thank you so much Cindy I wouldn't have gotten the job without your \nhelp not a problem at all I have complete confidence in your \nabilities I'm very excited to join the team and make a positive impact on the \ncompany the company operates in a competitive environment so give it your \nall I certainly will thanks once again \nafter Tom successfully joined the company Derek didn't like this fact he \nwas determined to make things difficult for [Applause] [Music] Tom Derek attempted various tricks to \ntrip Tom up and create trouble however Tom has great working \nskills and he approached his work with a serious and fair attitude Tom had clear \ngoals for his tasks because of this Tom progressed \nrapidly and none of Derrick's tricks could hinder his progress as time went on Tom's hard work \npaid off he was recognized for his dedication and \nskill and he earned a promotion on the other hand Derek \nstarted falling behind in his work because he was too focused on harming \nTom before long Derek faced the consequences of his actions and got \nsacked so Palm's determination and focus on personal growth not only led to his \nsuccess but also showed how kindness and hard work win over negative \nintention and that's today's lesson hope you enjoyed \nit

\nyou do you know how to write an email in the workplace is there something wrong you \nmade a lot of mistakes in this email first look you didn't write the \nemail subject line never ever have a blank subject line line how is your recipient supposed \nto know what your email is about if it doesn't have the specific line secondly the words you use in the \nemail are completely inappropriate for the workplace environment you need to use formal words \nwhen writing the email third you forgot to attach the document to the \nemail it wasn't the first time you've made this mistake I don't want it to happen again \nI'm so sorry I promise never to make the same mistakes again plus the person who \nhas responded or is involved in the project needs to be cced or bccd in the \nemail finally no more spelling mistakes and remember there must be a signature \nin the email I got it sir I will keep that in mind and Natalie last time you didn't \nsubmit the report on time if you still make such mistakes you will be \nfired yes \nsir you look so sad Natalie what happened I got scolded by my boss \nbecause I made a lot of mistakes in my email if this situation keeps happening \nI'm afraid

don't worry I will help you really you're so kind thank you very \nmuch don't mention it to write a professional email you need to pay \nattention to these things what are they before writing or sending an email you \nneed to have a professional email address this email address is one you \nuse for work so make sure to use it only for work rated purposes or formal \ncommunication is it the email address the company gave me that's right for all \nthe work rated matters you need to use that email address okay I got it every email needs \nto have a subject line you need to write a concise informative subject line it is \na short phrase that summarizes the reason for your email message for example can I write it like \nthis revenue reports 3rd quarter 2022 you are learning \nfast thank you when you click reply all you must be \ncareful because that means you've emailed your response to both the sender of the previous message and everyone who \nre receive the original email okay I'll keep this in mind you \nalso need to create your personal email signature do you know how to create \none yes I do is there anything I need to pay special attention to it should \ninclude your full name job title a photo of yourself a direct phone number and a \nhyperlink website address a professional signature allows you to promote your \nbrand and and Company oh I'm still missing the website \naddress I will add it later when you write an email you should begin with an \nappropriate greeting slang overly friendly or overly \nstiff language must always be avoided I see if so I bet I can't use \ninterjections or exclamation points either right that's right you should \nkeep everything short simple and formal and if you write an email to foreign clients you should pay attention \nto cultural differences to avoid unnecessary problems such useful knowledge thank you \nfor telling me this no problem and last but not least \nyou must always double check everything before sending it
