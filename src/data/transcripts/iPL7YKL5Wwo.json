This is life and we need to be realistic \nTrue, but a guy can dream, can't he? \nBesides, what's the harm\nin a little fantasy every now and then? \nNone at all, my friend. None at all. \nYeah. And who knows, maybe one day those dreams will become reality. \nI hope so, anyway. \nWe'll make it through another Monday together. \nYup. Thanks for listening, Anna. \nThat's what colleagues are for, right? \nThat's right. \nWhat a boring day. \nSo hungry. \nWhat's this? \nA lottery ticket? \nHuh, must've been dropped by someone. \n10, 01, 28, 49, 59, 21 \nWell, what's the harm in holding on to it? \nWhat are you watching? Tom? \nOh, just checking out today's lottery results. \nYou buy a lottery ticket? \nYeah. \nJust thought I'd try my luck for once. \nWhat's up America? I'm Linda Smith. \nIt's Monday, 1 April. \nAnd tonight's mega jackpot is an estimated $1.3 billion. \nTo win the jackpot, you must be 5 white balls, plus that gold mega ball. \nIt's the first time\nyou've bought a lottery ticket, right? \nYep. \nSo tonight's winning numbers are 10, 01, 28, 49, 59. \nAnd the gold mega ball is 21. \nSeems like chasing wealth through the lottery is pointless. \nWe'll never win. \nI think I won. \nWhat did you say? \nI've won the lottery! \n1.3 billion. \n1.3 billion. \nWhere's the ticket? \nI left it in my pants pocket. \nThe pants I wore to work today. \nWhere are the pants? \nNothing. \nReally? \nSo where's the ticket? \nI don't know. \nTom, we need to find that lottery ticket. \nI know, I know. \nWhere did you last have it? \nI remember putting it in my pocket,\nbut then I changed clothes. \nDid you check your backpack? \nWait a minute. \nI think I left it in my backpack. \nThank goodness. \nI can't believe we almost lost it. \nWell, now we found it. \nCan you imagine, Tom, we're going to be rich. \nI know it's unbelievable. \nJust think of all the things we can do with that kind of money. \nWe could travel the world, buy a fancy cars. \nLive in a mansion. \nI could finally quit my job\nand never have to worry about bills again. \nExactly. \nWe\u2019ll be living the dream. \nWe'll have the freedom\nto do whatever we want, whenever we want. \nIt's going to be amazing. \nGood morning, Anna. \nOh. What's this? \nI got this for you. \nYou bought this for me? \nRemember what you said yesterday? \nBuy me a hamburger if you win the lottery. \nWell, here you go. \nThanks anyway. \nLarry, can you finish the report today\ninstead of tomorrow? \nNo. I'm sorry. \nWhy? \nI've got something more important\nto take care of today than that report. \nWhat's that? \nQuitting my job. \nCome on, Larry, don't joke like that. \nI'm not joking. I'm serious. Jack. \nOkay. \nI heard from Jack that you want to quit, Larry. \nI wanted to confirm this with you. \nIt's true. Peter. \nI don't think it's a wise decision. \nThat is my final decision. \nIs there an issue at the company\nthat's bothering you? \nWorking in this boring place is the biggest issue. \nIt would be better if you give notice\nbefore leaving your position. \nNot just like this. \nThis month's salary, I don't need it. \nI just want to quit. \nYou can go. \nAre you crazy? \nDo you know what you're doing? \nI'm doing what\nI should have done a long time ago. \nYou don't need this job anymore? \nWhy? \nYou know why? \nYou really won the lottery? \nYep. \nHow much? \n$1.3 billion. \nCongratulations. \nThat's amazing. \nBut it's not right to resign like this. \nThe boss is being very polite to you. \nI think it's time for me to go. \nI'll see you around, Anna. \nMaybe I'll invite you to a yacht party this weekend. \nKeep in touch. \nWinning the lottery really changes a person? \nin a not so good way.... \nI'm going to get the $1.3 billion Tom. \nI'll wait for you to come back. \nAnd then we'll have a great dinner tonight. \nSure thing. \nPlease check the information\non this winning lottery ticket. \nIt belongs to me. \nSo. \nI'm sorry, but this isn't the winning ticket. \nYou're just kidding, right? \nPlease. Look. \nYou've got the wrong date. \nThe correct date is April 1st, 2024. \nBut your ticket is March 31st, 2024. \nI'm sorry, but don't be too sad. \nI am all ears, Alex. \nJohn. \nHow is the RV? \nExcept for the shell and the engine, \nEverything needs to be in the trash. \nOh, so there are tons to repair and replace. \nThat could take a whole month. \nWhen will you come? \nIn the afternoon. \nI am busy at the moment. \nFine. \nWell, well. \nHow long do you think\nit will take us to finish this? \nIf you do not miss any Saturday or Sunday, \nit will be a month. \nOh, well, that cannot be helped. \nNow let's investigate it from the inside. \nWill you take wooden floors or something else? \nJust plywood. \nThen we have to make it waterproof. \nAnd we need to add lights. \nOkay. \nOur bed will be in this corner. \nThere should be bunk beds to fit us all. \nFortunately, all the pipelines are still functioning. \nOkay. \nand our kitchen will be at the back of the car, right? \nRight. \nCall Kuroi and tell him to run the lights and electricity on the whole car. \nTires and glass also need replacing. \nThe shell should be repainted. \nWe do not need that, just plaster it. \nWith our destructive activities, the paint will peel off in no time. \nYes. That's fine. \nI have plywood. \nNow let's order all the listed materials, and then we can start laying the floor. \nAll done. \nOur month-long feat! \nNeat. \nTry starting the engine, Alex. \nNice!!! \nThe power line works. \nAnd the water line also works. \nI also installed an addtional awning, \nin case we want to stay outside during light rain. \nGreat. \nSo when do we go? \nNext week \nWe will go to Mount Baker. \nHooray! \nHere we are. \nThe beautiful natural landscape of Mount Baker. \nFresh air it is! \nCome on, let's prepare everything\nfor a fun camping night. \nNow, John and I will find some firewood. \nKuroi and Clay, you two prepare the tent, ok? \nClear. \nOh, you set the table as well. \nThat didn't take much time. \nLet's make a campfire. \nOh, no. \nI forgot to bring my torch. \nIt's okay. \nWe can make a fire with some sticks. \nIt's time to do what I've been practicing. \nGood job, Alex. \nLet's grill the food. \nFood cooked like this is so much tastier. \nSo warm. \nYeah. \nThe steak is delicious. \nToo bad there's no rosemary. \nNext time I will bring it. \nHey, how the pot of potato soup, Alex? \nIt's done. We can eat now. \nKuroi, do not go too far. \nI know, \ndoes it work? \nIt does, in around 50 meters range. \nDo you want to try it? \nYes. \nWow! It is bright as day. \nLet me guess. \nYou made it yourself, right? \nThat's right. \nKuroi is truly our inventor. \nLet's clean up the tables and chairs. \nThe rain is getting heavier and heavier. \nEveryone, let's get in the car. \nWe'll go to bed soon. \nStunning. \nIt rained heavily yesterday and today it's sunny. \nThanks to that, the sky is clear. \nIt's perfect to go to the beach now. \nThat's a great idea. \nOn the way back to Seattle,\nWe will stop by Libbey Beach. \nWe will have lunch there\nand then return home in the evening. \nDo you \nDeal? \nWoo-hoo! The sky was even clearer than on the mountain. \nLet's set up the party speaker, \nWe're going to party hard this afternoon. \nOh, great. \nLet me get more drinks. \nJohn, we still need to light the fire. \nYes, a party without a barbecue is not a party. \nHello, handsome guys. \nAre you guys not from here? \nTrue. \nWe are from Seattle. \nNice to meet you guys. \nWhere do you come from? \nWe are all from Coupeville. \nIs that near? \nYeah, it's pretty near. \nAre you guys getting a party together? \nYeah, right. \nWe will start the fire and music\nin a few minutes. \nDo you want to join in? \nOf course. \nIt's quite late. \nWe have to go home. \nI wish you guys were here longer. \nWe'll be back. Don't worry. \nSee you guys soon. \nWe're also going to Seattle. \nCan I have your contact? \nSure. \nIt's been fun partying with you guys. \nThank you so much for having us. \nWe enjoyed it too. \nSee you. \nBye. \nLucy. \nI'm really nervous about this company party. \nI want to look nice,\nbut I don't know what to wear. \nDon't worry.
