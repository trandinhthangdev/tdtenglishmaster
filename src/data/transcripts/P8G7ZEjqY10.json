Thanks, Flavio. \nSo, are you ready to introduce yourself? \nI'm Maxim, 2...7, Russi...a. \nOkay... Thanks, Maxim. \nThank you for sharing, class. \nAnd it's great to have such a diverse\nclass from so many countries here. \nAll right, everyone, let's open\nour books to the first page. \nWe'll learn our first lesson today. \nHey, uhm... \nI don't know your name... anyway. \nCan I see your book with you? \nNo, I don't want. \nWhy not? \nWe can learn together. \nI just don't like it. \nOh. Come on. \nI don't want anything to do with you. \nWhat... what... you doing? \nI want to see book with you. \nI left it... home. \nBut... I don't like it too. \nShhhhh... \nNow, let's start with a simple question like: \n\"What's the weather like today?\" \nBecause I want to understand\nthe English level of our class. \nOk. Somi, how would you describe the weather? \nUm... Um... \nOkay, take your time. Now, Flavio? \nWell, maybe. Delicious. \nGood effort. Flavio. \nRemember, we're all here to learn. \nNam, can you share your thoughts\non different weather types? \nWeather types? \nYes, like rain, sunshine, snow... \nI don't know. Sorry. \nNo need to apologize, Nam. \nLearning takes time. \nNow. Maxim. \nRain is wet. Sun is hot. \nGood start, Maxim. \nLet's keep exploring. \nSo, class, what do you wear when it's hot? \nA scarf? \nA jacket? \nNot quite. \nActually, we wear shorts or light clothes when it's hot. \nWhat does light clothes mean? \nDoes anyone know what light clothes mean? \nLight clothes are shined in the dark. \nIs that right, teacher? \nNo, Gyaan. \nLight clothes typically refers to clothing items that are thin, not heavy. \nAnd suitable for summer or fall. \nIt's like t shirts, right? \nThat's right, Flavio. \nI get it. Thank you. \nYou're welcome. Somi. \nSo if clothes have much color,\nwhat do we call them? \nGood question. \nWe can call them \"bright clothes\" or \"light-colored clothes\". \nSo the clothes I... wear are \"dark clothes\"? \nThat's correct. Nam. \nThey're not good in English, but they are willing to learn. \nOnly Maxim seems to be quiet. \nBut it's okay. \nI can do this. \nSo that's it for today. \nI hope you like today's class. \nNext time we're going to learn basic grammar. \nSo get ready for that. \nYes, teacher. \nAnd I would like to say you guys were awesome today in how much you wanted to learn. \nEach of you showed a really good learning spirit, \nand it makes teaching a lot more fun and easy. \nThank you. \nYou're a great teacher. \nThank you. Nam. \nWhat did she say? \nShe said, \u201cthank you, Nam\u201d. \nNo, before. \nShe say we are fun and easy spirit. \nReally? \nYes! That's a compliment. \nCool. \nJust keep it up! Goodbye, class. \nExcuse me. \nCan you move? You're in my way. \nOh, sorry. \nDidn't see you there. \nLady, first. \nWhy she is so mean? \nKey! \nIt's hers? \nLook for something. \nIt's not your business. \nIs that my key? \nYour key? \nYup! \nDon't know. \nIt is my key. \nProve it. \nWhat? \nIt can be anyone's keys. \nGive it to me.
