    "transcript": "[Music] \nthe fireworks on New Year's Eve were \n[Music] \nspectacular wow look at those \nfireworks they're so bright and \ncolorful the fireworks on New Year's Eve \nwere \nspectacular I know right it's like a \nlight show in the sky the big red one \nlooked like a giant flower and the green \nones were like little \naliens do you think they plan the colors \nprobably it's also well \ncoordinated imagine setting all these \nfireworks up must be a lot of work but \nit's worth it it's getting chilly want \nmy scarf thanks Alex you're always so \nthoughtful anything for you Emma it's a \nperfect way to start the new year \nabsolutely do you have any \nresolutions to enjoy moments like this \nmore often that's a great resolution \nlet's make it happen I'm looking forward \nto it happy New Year \nAlex happy New Year Emma I'm glad we're \nhere together it's the best part of the \nnight with you every part is the best \n[Music] \npart that's a lovely \n[Music] \nidea I'm thinking of doing something \nspecial this \nweekend oh like what something for my \nfamily maybe a family dinner that's a \nlovely idea who will cook I was thinking \nI would cook really remember the last \ntime you \ncooked okay maybe we should order it \nthat sounds better what about \ndecorations I'll get some balloons and \nflowers balloons for a family dinner why \nnot it'll be \nfestive okay Mr festive what about \nmusic I can make a playlist of \neveryone's favorite \nsongs be careful with your sister's \nchoices right no heavy metal this \ntime and then I'd like to make a toast \nto \neveryone and not spill the drink this \ntime I'll try my best I hope my family \nenjoys it they will as long as you don't \ncook very \nfunny if you know what I \nmean \nhave you seen the new guy at \nwork yeah he's quite \ninteresting I heard he used to be a \ncircus \nperformer really that explains the \njuggling at \nlunch and his fashion sense is out of \nthis world you mean the sparkly shoes \nand hat exactly it's like a show every \nday if you know what I mean I get it but \nhe's really good at his job true he \nbrings a lot of energy did you see him \nin the meeting with the colorful tie oh \nthat tie was a statement a statement of \nfashion bravery for sure he makes our \noffice more \nlively can't deny that he's like a burst \nof \ncolor and his stories remember the one \nabout the \nlion how could I forget I was on the \nedge of my seat \nhe definitely has a way with words and \nwith people too everyone seems to like \nhim yeah he's a unique character in our \noffice I'm just glad he's on our team me \ntoo he brings a different \nperspective let's see what he does next \nit's never \nboring that's for sure every day is a \nnew \n[Music] \nsurprise there's nothing else to do \ntoday it's so boring today isn't \nit yeah feels like there's nothing else \nto \ndo we could watch a movie we've watched \nall the good ones \nalready how about going for a \nwalk it's raining outside \nremember right I \nforgot let's play a board game \nthen we lost the dice last \ntime that's \ntrue maybe we could cook something we \nneed to go grocery shopping first looks \nlike we're stuck with nothing to do we \ncould clean the \nhouse on a lazy day like today I'll \npass how about looking for a new \ngame that's an idea do you know any not \nreally let's look one up on the \nInternet good plan it's fun to learn \nsomething new and we have all the time \ntoday let's make the best out of this \nlazy \n[Music] \nday it seems all \nright have you seen my new bike yes yeah \nit looks really cool is it fast super \nfast but I think it makes a weird noise \na weird noise that's not \ngood yeah like a squeaking \nsound maybe it just needs some oil I \ntried that it seems all right now that's \ngreat do you want to go for a ride sure \nlet's \ngo wait where are my \nkeys your bike keys aren't they in your \npocket it oh no I can't find them maybe \nthey're still in class could be let me \ncheck found them they were under my \ntable let's go now before you lose them \nagain yeah race you to the park you're \non but let's be careful always
