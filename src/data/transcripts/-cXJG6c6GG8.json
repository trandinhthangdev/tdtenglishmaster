\nlast class \nokay Duke \nwe learned about gerunds and infinitives \nin English \n[Music] \nvery good what are gerunds and \ninfinitives with examples \na gerund is a verb that ends in ing and \nis used as a noun walking traveling \nvoting \nan infinitive is the base form of a verb \npreceded by two such as to walk to \ntravel to vote \ngerunds and infinitives can be used as \nthe subject the complement or the object \nof a sentence \nexactly \nis there a case in which verbs are \nfollowed by a two infinitive or Ing and \nthe difference in meaning is often small \neight like love and prefer can be \nfollowed either by ing or a too \ninfinitive \ngood job alright let's check your \nhomework have you done all your homework \nyet \nsorry Mr Brad I forgot to do my homework \ndoes anyone else forget to do homework \nsorry Mr Brad yesterday we had a small \nparty and we all forgot to do our \nhomework \nhmm I feel very disappointed \non behalf of the class I deeply \napologize Mr Brad \n[Music] \nsince all of you haven't done your \nhomework I will let you stay here after \nclass to finish it \nno Mr Brad \nthe class will end at 5 PM instead of 4 \npm as usual okay \nyes \nthen to ensure the quality of today's \nlesson I will collect everyone's cell \nphones including mine \noh no \nDuke but these phones the locker in the \nhallway \nokay Mr Brad \n[Music] \nplease come in \nwell I heard someone at the door do you \nhear that \nyes I do hear it \nit's so strange let me see \noh my God \nwhat's wrong Mr Brad \nwhy is the door locked \nwhat the door is locked \nyes Sid Sid are you out there \nMr Brad everyone seems to have left what \nmust we do now \nGod we're gonna be locked up here \nwe don't even have a phone to contact \nother people \ncalm down everyone we will find a way \nout \nbut The English Center will reopen on \nMonday does that mean we'll be locked up \nhere for three days \n[Music] \nsurely my mother would be extremely \nworried \nlisten listen everyone we need to be \ncalm \nwe have to think of a way out \nwhat should we do now how to get out of \na locked room \nshould we break the door \nbut we have nothing to break the door \nyou're right \nor maybe we jump from the window \nwhat are you crazy do you know what \nfloor we are on \nfourth floor so what \njumping off is dangerous falling from a \nfour-story window can cause death or \nSerious injury or break your leg \nit's hard to find a way out \nyeah there is no other way \nI don't want to be locked up here we \nwill starve \nno we have food and drink remember \nJasmine and Duke's presents \nwe have me a box of apple juice owned a \nbox of a canned foods oh that's right I \nremember very lucky indeed \nat least we'll have enough food until \nMonday \nall right in the meantime do you guys \nwant to play a game \nsure sure I love playing games me too \nwhat are we going to play \nword matching game \ncan you explain in more detail \nokay this is a game to review old \nlessons for example if I said avoid you \nwould have to answer verb ing or to verb \nand then give an example do you guys \nunderstand the game \nokay \nthe first word is enjoy \nenjoy is followed by verb ing and my \nexample is \nI always enjoy cooking \nwell done all right the next word is \npromise \nthe verb is followed by an infinitive I \npromise to do my homework \nright well another word is try \ncan be followed by an infinitive form \nno try followed by verb ing \nwell both are correct \nwhy Mr Broad \nis a special verb in English because it \ncan be followed with either a gerund or \ninfinitive however the meaning changes \nthe meaning changes \nyes let's see two examples I tried \ncalling her but the line was busy and I \ntried to call her but the line was busy \nI tried calling means he thought phoning \nmight be the way to do it \nI tried to call means he made an effort \nwell so the difference is very small \ntry doing is experimenting with doing \ntry to do is about making an effort \noh I get it \nnow who wants to sing a song \n[Music] \nit's eight o'clock now \nyeah all of our plans failed \nI plan to have dinner with my girlfriend \ntonight this
