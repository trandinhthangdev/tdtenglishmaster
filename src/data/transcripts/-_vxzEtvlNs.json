can't \nhandle the \ntruth every time I say it you guys go \ncrazy I've tried saying an American \naccent a British accent fast slow I've \neven tried singing it but for some \nreason you guys are obsessed I don't \nunderstand \nit what what what there you go you \nhappy hi can I take your order hello \nmate can I please have a wait are you \nBritish yeah why \num it's just that uh uh the translator \nisn't here it's it's just me so but we \nboth speak English it's not like I'm \ntalking another language hey you know \nwhat I can do this may I take your order \nright so can I please have a tomato \nsandwich with Bine cche a packet of \ncrisp and a bottle of water cheers mate \noh and a cookie for \npudding get \nSmall Differences \nout well it's really interesting how the \nsame language changes across the \nAtlantic yes let's start with how we say \nwords \nlike w a \nt in the US we say it like water and we \nreally hear the r at the end it's \ndifferent in the UK we say water softer \nand with a clearer T these small things \nmake English diverse and interesting \ntrue and it's not just how we say words \nthe words we use are also different for \nexample I live in an apartment what do \nyou call it kale we call it a flat and \nwe have different words for transport \ntoo in the UK we use a lry to move Goods \nbut in the US you say \ntruck these differences can be confusing \nbut also fun when we try to understand \neach \nother right Linda and we can't forget \nabout grammar there are many small \ndifferences like when we talk about \nthings we did that's true kale in the US \nwe might say I already ate in the UK K \nyou might say I've already eaten exactly \nit's these details that make British and \nAmerican English special knowing them \nhelps us talk better and enjoy the \nlanguage more I totally agree with you K \nso have you ever encountered a funny or \nawkward situation due to the differences \nbetween British and American \nEnglish Christmas is coming are you \nexcited Linda absolutely kale I can't \nwait to decorate my Christmas tree got \nto make it fabulous so what do you think \nis the most interesting difference \nbetween Christmas in the US and the UK \nwhy do you feel that \nway it's interesting to see how we \ncelebrate differently across the ocean \nespecially with unique traditions and \nwoods yeah like when I first heard of \nChristmas crackers in the UK I thought \nthey were a type of food no they're not \na food in the UK they are colorful items \nthat open with a pop inside you find a \njoke a small toy and a paper hat they \nmake Christmas fun and joyful that's \nreally different from the US K here \ncrackers are just food and what about \nSanta Claus in the UK they often Call \nHim Father Christmas this name is very \nold he's sometimes seen more like a \nwinter figure not the same as the happy \nSanta in the US who brings gifts true \nLinda and Christmas food is also \ndifferent in the UK people eat minced \npies and Christmas pudding this pudding \nis a heavy fruit cake not like a amican \npudding it's an old recipe from the \nVictorian era we don't have Christmas \npudding in the US our pudding is a sweet \ndessert that's creamy like a mousse or \npanacotta oh I see that's new to me but \nChristmas cookies are popular in the US \nfamilies make different cookies and \nshare them with friends and neighbors \nit's all about sharing \nhappiness and we drink eggnog a creamy \nsweet drink made with milk sugar and \neggs UK Christmas lights are often less \nflashy more elegant our cities glue with \nsoft festive lights it's more \ntraditional in the us we love bright \nChristmas lights some houses have so \nmany lights they look like a festival \nit's about half having fun and spreading \njoy and don't forget the Christmas \njumpers in the UK they're bold and fun \nit's a cheerful way to celebrate the \nholiday exactly kale it's amazing that \neven though we speak the same language \nour Christmas traditions are so \ndifferent it makes the holiday more \nspecial absolutely Linda Christmas is \nabout joy and these differences make it \nmore \nmagical have you ever tried any of these \nTraditions we'd love to hear from you \nFunny misunderstandings \nnow let's delve into some amusing \nmisunderstandings between British and \nAmerican English oh this is going to be \nfun kale let's start with the word \nrubber in the UK it's something you use \nin school right exactly Linda a rubber \nin the UK is what you'd call an aaser in \nthe US but in America a rubber has \na let's say a very different \nuse it certainly does now what about \npants in the UK they're what you wear \nunder your trousers correct right but in \nthe US pants are what we in the UK call \ntrousers quite a mixup when an American \nin the UK says they need to buy new \npants absolutely and let's not forget \nbiscuit in the UK it's a sweet treat \nyou'd have with tea but in the US it's \nmore like a soft bread roll often served \nwith gravy oh That's a classic now in \nthe US you use Fanny to mean your \nbackside but in the UK it's a bit more \nshall we say delicate that's a good one \nto be careful with and let's talk about \ncars in the UK you fill up with petrol \nbut in the US we get gas yes and our \nboot is your trunk you can imagine the \nconfusion when a Brit asks an American \nto put their suitcase in the boot that \nwould raise some \neyebrows and lift in the UK is an \nelevator in the US imagine my surprise \nthe first time I was told to take the \nlift it's these little differences that \ncan lead to funny yet memorable \nexperiences listeners have you ever had \na mixup due to these language \ndifferences we love to hear your stories \ndefinitely share your funny \nmisunderstandings with \nSummary \nus as we finish today's episode of \nBritish English or American English \nlet's remember what we talked about we \nlooked at how British and American \nEnglish are different in the way we \nspeak and use words it's been very \ninteresting kale we talked about \nChristmas everyday words and the funny \nmistakes that can happen we learned a \nlot about how
