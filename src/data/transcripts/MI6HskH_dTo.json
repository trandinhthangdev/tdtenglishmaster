    "transcript": "Why does it take so long? \nI don't know. \nIt seems quite tight. \nNormally the meeting just last two hours. \nNow it's three hours already. \nMaybe there are some problems\nwith the new project. \nHey! He's coming. \nHe is crying, isn't he? \nOh my god. I think that project is extremely perfect. \nWhat happened with him? \nHey Luke, what happened? \nIs everything okay? \nCome on Luke, everything will be fine. \nJust let us know what happened. \nThen we can discuss finding solution. \nDon't cry like a child like this. \nI'm okay. \nI'm okay. \nReally? Come on, you can share your problems with us. \nI'm fine. Really. I'm just... \nJust what? \nOh, I'm just so happy. \nWhat? Are you kidding me? \nNo no. Just... I was just promoted. \nAnd I'm so happy. I couldn\u2019t hold back the tears. \nI have been working here for like 4 years \nand it's the first time I am promoted. \nOh my. You are so incredible. \nCongrats \nI thought there were some mistakes with the project. \nNo, no. \nEverything is fine. \nThe project is highly appreciated. \nWe can start next week. \nSo which position will you be in now? \nI will be the Vice Chief of the Planning Department. \nThat's great. \nBut there is no Vice Chief crying like this. \nDon't cry. \nThis is good news, isn't it? \nYes, I know. But the tear is still falling. I'm so sorry. \nOh, a cry baby. \nI was really nervous when I saw you crying. \nI'm so sorry. \nThank you for supporting me to complete this project. \nPleasure. \nWe should celebrate a party tonight. \nCongrats, right? \nSure. Do you have time tonight, Luke? \nAbsolutely. I have an idea. \nLet's come to my house. \nI will treat this time. \nExcellent. \nDeal. \nSee you then. \nHey! What's the matter with him? \nHe looks like he's going to be sick. \nShould we take him to the hospital? \nYou didn't read his post on Facebook? \nNot yet. I'm too busy today. \nWhat happened? \nHe lost Lucy. \nLucy? His puppy? \nI still saw her playing in the yard yesterday. \nYes. He lost her this morning. \nOh my God. \nHe tried to find her in the park\nand some roads nearby. \nBut the result is zero. \nHe must be freaking out. \nLucy seems to be his family member. \nRight. That is the reason why he is blanky now. \nIf I were him, I would cry like a river. \nThe poor boy. \nWhat can we help him with? \nI don't know. \nI helped him to call Lucy around here all morning. \nBut you know... \nThat\u2019s bad. \nDo you have any ideas? \nI think they should print some missing\nposts and stick them around this area. \nThat's a good idea. \nYes. One of my friends found his cat after 3 days by that way. \nPerfect. \nLet me talk and appease him first. \nHey, Matt. \nI'm so sorry about Lucy. \nThat's fine. \nIt's my fault. \nI didn't put my eyes on her\nwhen letting her go outside. \nCome on. Everyone has a mistake. \nWe'll try our best to find her. \nOkay? \nI tried. But you know... \nI have an idea. \nThat is printing the missing posters\nand sticking them around. \nAnyone who sees her can call you. \nThat's a big help. \nWait for me here and I will print them. \nThen we can go around together. \nOkay. \nThank you so much. \nDave, do you want to go to the supermarket with me? \nSupermarket? \nYes, absolutely. \nWe are going to go right now, aren't we, mom? \nIn 10 minutes. \nYou should go back to your room and change clothes. \nIt may be cold outside. \nOkay, mom. \nWait for me for a couple of minutes. \nSure. \nLet's go. Let's go, mom. \nPumpkin, do you think that you forgot anything? \nNah. I don't think so. \nI got my coat, my boots, my scarf, and my hat. \nI don't need gloves, mom. My coat has pockets. \nI think you forgot one important thing. \nWhat is it, mom? \nA mask? \nOh, yes. \nBut why do you have to wear a mask, mom? \nIt makes me feel breathless sometimes. \nListen, Dave. \nYou know, in the air outside there are many bacteria and viruses. \nAnd, masks protect us from them, is that right? \nYes. My boy. \nBacteria and viruses\ncan cause many diseases for us. \nSome of them are very dangerous. \nOh, really? \nIt's so scary. \nYes. Using masks is one of the most\neffective ways to protect ourselves. \nI understand mom. \nAnd you know, you're flu, right? \nYes, but I feel better today. \nMasks will help us to protect the ones who talk with us when we are sick. \nThey are a great thing, aren't they? \nThat's right. \nNow, put your mask on then we are going to the supermarket. \nOkay, mom. \nHey, did you know anything? \nWhat? \nWhat are you talking about? \nHey. What's up? \nTwo of you don't know anything\nabout Jane and Eddie. \nNo, what happened with them? \nThey're getting married, aren't they? \nJesus, I know that. \nI know that. \nJane is a good girl. And Eddie is also a perfect guy. \nBut why didn't she tell us anything? \nThat's weird. \nWe should give her a penalty for it. \nNo, no. \nCome on. \nYou guys don't know anything. Really? \nOh, come on. \nDon't beat around the bush like this. \nThey broke up. \nOh my goodness. Really? \nUnbelievable. \nWho told you that? \nJane. \nYou know she's cuckolded. \nThat's shocking. \nI thought Eddie was a nice guy. \nThey look so happy all the time. \nMaybe it's the reason why she's off today. \nPoor Jane. \nShe told me that she found out Eddie was dating another girl 1 week before. \nAnd they argued. \nThen she decided to break up. \nJerk. \nI can't understand what he thought. \nI can't agree with you more. \nJane is a pretty girl, and I remember that \nshe's a runner up in the Miss University contest. \nYes. It's hard to find another girl\nas perfect as her. \nShe's also smart and good at business. \nShe shouldn't forgive him. \nNever. \nI hear that girl is his colleague. \nOh, that's the worst. \nThanks for letting us know. \nI think we should appease her. \nShe may be crying at home. \nYes. Wanna come to her home tonight? \nSure. I'll call her in advance. \nLong time no see, Anna. \nYou look so beautiful these days. \nOh, really? \nThank you. \nYou are so pretty, too. \nHow is it going? Is everything good? \nYes. It's quite good. \nMy parents said that they miss you so much. \nI miss them, too. \nIt has been a long time since I studied abroad. \nThis time, I will be here to work. \nReally? \nWon't you come back to Los Angeles to work? \nYes. I wanna settle down here, Chicago. \nWow. I think it's good for you. \nYour family is still here. \nYou should live near them to take care of them. \nThat is exactly what I think. \nSo what is your job? \nI think I'll start work in the marketing field. \nWell, I have had a degree when I studied abroad and also have experience. \nThat helps you a lot. \nI don't think it's hard to find a job here to earn the living. \nRight. Don't worry. \nThere are a lot of opportunities for you to find a well-paid job here. \nI hope so. How about you? \nAre you still working as a teacher in high school? \nYes. I've had this job\nsince I graduated from university. \nIs it good? \nAre there any difficulties? \nActually, I find it interesting. \nI have a sense of happiness when I see my students learn hard. \nGood! How about the working atmosphere? \nVery good, to be honest. \nMy colleagues help me a lot. \nI can learn a lot of things from them. \nI'm so happy to hear that. \nHello, are you Anna? \nYes, I'm Anna. \nHi. Nice to meet you. \nI'm John. \nI'm the person referred to meet you. \nAh, yes. Hi John. Nice to meet you. \nYou look even more beautiful than in the photo. \nOh, thank you so much. \nWhat kind of drink would you like? \nI'd like orange juice. \nOkay. \nI have heard that you are working in the tourism field. \nCan I ask which company you are working for? \nAh yes. I'm currently working as a manager at K-travel. \nMy major is travel services. \nThat's really amazing. I'm a big fan of traveling. \nThat's great. \nI can give you some ideas. \nThanks. And how about the time? \nHow much time do you spend on your work? \nWell, it depends on the number of customers. \nReally? \nThe features of this profession depend on the period of time that tourists travel. \nThe holidays will be extremely busy. \nOkay, I see. \nAnd I'm a teacher at high school. \nMy school is in the center of our city. \nDo you work at Greenville High School? \nYes. Why do you know that? \nI haven't introduced this. \nI guess. \nBecause my sister also works here. \nAnd I graduated from this school. \nThat's great. I may know her. \nIt is a coincidence. \nYes. \nWhen did you graduate? \nTen years ago. \nSurprisingly. \nAnd my company is quite near this school. \nCan I have a chance to pick you up\nand have lunch some day? \nOf course. I'm willing to. \nDo you have my phone number? \nYes, I have. \nSo if you have free time, \nyou can text me anytime. \nExcuse me. \nYes. \nMay I ask you what time it is? \nI forgot my phone at home. \nAh yes. But are you Anna? \nYes. Oh. Jenny. \nYou're Jenny, right? \nExactly. Me, Jenny. \nOh my god, long time no see. \nI couldn't realize you. \nI'm so happy to see you here. \nWhy are you here? You went abroad for work. \nWhy did you suddenly appear? \nWhen did you come back? \nAnna, I will answer all your questions. \nYes. I'm just so happy. \nI came back 1 week ago. \nI have planned to tell you next week when my job is to settle down here. \nYou mean you came back to work here? \nSeriously? \nYes, seriously. \nOh, dear. Surprisingly. \nHaha. I just changed the workplace. \nNow I am a chef in JK restaurant. \nIt is near here. Do you know that? \nOf course. \nSometimes we have meetings in this restaurant. \nReally? \nNow have a chance to join our class meeting each year. \nYes. Everyone said that they missed you so much. \nWe haven't seen each other for a long time. \nSo now we can hang out any time. \nI'm so excited about it. \nSo where do you work now? \nI am a lawyer. I work in Block C in Lombard Street. \nWow. I'm so proud of my friend. \nHow amazing you are. \nWhen I was a child,\nI also dreamed of being a lawyer. \nDon't mention it. \nI'll call Alex and Alice to inform them that you came back. \nI'm sure they're very happy. \nAnna. How is it going? \nJack, long time no see. \nI heard from Jenny that you've changed your job. \nIs it true? \nYes. I'll have the first day\nin the new company tomorrow morning. \nGood! What do you do? \nYou may be surprised when I tell you. \nMarketing. \nmarketing. \nI remember you haven't learned it before. \nRight. \nI am challenging myself in a new field. \nI'm feeling so excited to be doing what I love. \nhow do you feel about it? \nI found it quite interesting. \nI learned a bit about it before, but just a little bit. \nI'm happy when I hear you say that. \nit's very good when you can follow what you like. \nYes. \nBut why did you quit your previous job? \nIs it bad? \nNot really. \nI don't know why but I always felt tired when I worked. \nI didn't have any energy. \nSo it's not bad... \nHow boring it is. \nOh, I'm sure you suffered a lot of tiredness. \nYes. The new job is different. \nAlthough I have to learn everything, \nit's totally new to me, I'm still so excited. \nFortunately, you have found a job you love. \nIt's never too late if you're passionate about something. \nTry your best. \nOf course. \nI will always be by your side and support you. \nThank you so much for supporting me. \nYou also supported me\nwith every decision that I made. \nI will try my best to reach my dream. \n"
