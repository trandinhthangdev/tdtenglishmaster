her behavior and attitudes are quite important as well i think we need to \nfigure out which way is the best do you think we should go meet her teacher \nfor what come on emma one teacher will have to take responsibility for three to five classes \nthey don't have time to focus on only anne so what should we do \nyou need to find out one solution not only deny all of my opinions \nwhat do you think

type \nlet me show you some styles to see which one you prefer okay \nabout the length you better have shoulder length hair shorter than that will make your face \nlook bigger would you like curly or do you prefer straight hair \ncurly ones look great though do you think so like this one \nyes this is a long bomb style with wavy hair it suits you even more because your hair \nis a bit thin your

start everyone today we have \nthis meeting to discuss the preparation for our company's christmas year-end party next month are you ready \nyes we are all ready okay jessica please note down everything \nand make a report for today's meeting i will note down all the points \nafter today's meeting we need to finalize the following main points the date of the event the number of \npeople which restaurant the food and drink menu and the decoration theme \nthis information will be sent to the catering company to prepare with the restaurant \nso let's start with the number of people kate after surveying departments the most \nreasonable date is probably on the thursday night of the week before \nthe holiday there are 127 people where do you all think we should hold \nthis event the catering company has suggested three restaurants that can accommodate that number of people as in \nthe document in front of you all it's blue plate via corrada \nand scarpetta i think we need a budget before having any decision on this \noh yes sorry after the discussion with the board the agreed budget for a person \nis eighty dollars about sixty percent for food and drink and the rest is for \ndecorations gifts and other expenses i think scarpetta restaurant is the best \none the place is near our company they also have a package that has a discount on \nalcoholic drinks we can save a lot of money with this i think so teal scarpetta seems good \nwhat do the others think do you all agree with scarpetta we agree \nalright final decision is scarpetta next the food and drink menu everyone \ni think the first thing is to see how many people have special diets to tell the restaurant to prepare for them \ngood idea after today's meeting josh takes a look at the number of religious \npeople or has special diets and sends it back to jessica so she can include it in \nthe report we will then ask the restaurant about these servings \nyes okay with that amount of funds scarpetta is proposing two options as shown on \npage five who's with option one \nwho's with option two good then we take option one \nthe main dishes are stuffed with green chicken breast with parmigiano grilled \nangus new york steak and salmon roulade okay how about the drink \npage six in the package each person can order an alcoholic drink from the bar \nwe should put some soft drinks also on the table for those who don't drink alcohol \ngood we nearly finished only decoration theme left any ideas \nlast year we had a black theme with golden decorations but it was kind of gloomy how about trying white and red \nthis year i agree red makes it feel more like christmas everyone can dress in white \nalso still kinda easy i like red too \nokay so dress code white and red kate i will leave the decoration part for your \nteam okay we will take care of it thanks everyone for joining the meeting \ntoday we're done here jessica please send me a report tomorrow afternoon \nsure i will thank you [Music] \nPreparing a Wedding \nprepare a wedding [Music] \nethan we need to discuss our wedding okay louisa let's do it i've researched \nonline there are a lot of things that need to
