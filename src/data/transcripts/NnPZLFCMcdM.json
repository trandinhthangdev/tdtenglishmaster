\nHomeless people \nhomeless people \nwhen you see a homeless person on the street do you give him or her some money \nthat's a good question my mom said that I should not give anything why did your mom say that \nwe should be kind and we should help each other right I know but we're not sure whether they \nare really homeless or not that makes sense \nright that's why whenever I see a homeless person I feel bad for them but I don't know what to do \nnow you have me feeling confused too anyway if that day I'm generous enough I \nwill give them a meal that's nice we can buy some food for them

absolutely \n[Music] \nStay at a hotel \nstay at a hotel \nI'm going on a trip next week and I'm trying to decide whether to stay at a hotel or Homestay \nwhat do you guys think it depends on what you're looking for \nhotels can be great because they have conveniences like room service housekeeping and sometimes even a pool \nor gym but Homestay can be cheaper and give you a unique experience \nyou could stay in a local neighborhood and feel like you're part of the culture \nthat's true I guess it just depends on what I value \nmore well if you do decide to stay at a hotel make sure you read reviews beforehand \nyou want to make sure it's clean safe and has good customer service and don't forget to check for any hidden \nfees like Resort fees or parking fees those can really add up and make your \nstay more expensive than you thought wow thanks for your advice I've decided \nto stay at a hotel now great and have fun on your trip \nsure thing [Music] \nHealthy lifestyle \nhealthy lifestyle \nI've been thinking a lot lately about living a healthier lifestyle \ndo you guys have any tips well you can start by having more fruits \nand vegetables in your diet yes and drink plenty of water \nyou will feel much better when you're hydrated well that makes sense \nwhat about exercise I know that's a big part of a healthy lifestyle \nyes it is you don't have to go crazy with it try to get some physical activity every \nday even just walking or doing some stretches can make a big difference Lucy is Right find something you enjoy \nif you hate running Don't force yourself to do it try swimming hiking dancing Whatever \nGets you moving and feels fun oh I see one more thing don't forget mental \nhealth it's as important as physical health that's true you can practice mindfulness \nor meditation just taking a few minutes each day to focus on your breath be present in the \nmoment it can help reduce stress and anxiety thanks guys this is great advice I will \ntry and see how it goes that's fantastic just remember that small changes can add up to Big results \nover time [Music] \nIf I were you\u2026 \nif I were you foreign \n[Music] I'm not sure what to do about this \nsituation with my friend what's wrong she keeps canceling our plans at the \nlast minute and it's really upsetting if I were you I would talk to her about \nhow I feel let her know that you understand that things come up but you need her to value your time and \nrespecting each other's schedules that's a good idea and let her know that if this continues \nto happen you might not be able to make plans with her anymore but isn't that a bit serious \nwhat if she gets upset or defensive when I bring it up if I were you I would try to approach \nthe conversation calmly let her know that you're coming from a place of concern and that you value your \nfriendship be open to hearing her perspective too baby something is going on in her life \nthat's causing her to cancel so much okay I see what you were saying thanks \nfor the advice foreign \nWhat problems does it solve? \nwhat problems does it solve [Music] \nI'm not sure why we still need this new software what problems is it actually going to \nsolve it will simplify our workflow and make things more efficient \nokay but how exactly will it work for example it will automate certain \ntasks that are currently done manually like data entry or file organization \nthat will save us time and reduce the risk of errors I see but what about the cost \nis it worth investing in this software I think we should consider the long-term \nbenefits yes there might be an initial cost but over time it will pay off \nit helps increase productivity and better results okay I'm starting to see the bigger \npicture now thanks for explaining it to me [Music] \nWhy do you need more than one? \nwhy do you need more than one [Music] \nhey guys how's it going great I just got a new bag today it's so \ncute [Music] that's cool I still have my trusty old backpack I \ndon't understand why you need so many bags well I like to have different bags for \ndifferent occasions I have one bag that goes with everything and it's all I need \noh I can't stand having only one bag for me bags are like accessories they \ncan completely change the look of an outfit plus it's fun to collect them \nI see your point but I think I agree with Kai I only have one bag too \nso I don't have to worry about choosing which one to use yeah exactly \nand if I ever need a different type of bag I can just borrow one from you Linda \nno problem to each their own right absolutely as long as it makes you happy \nthat's all that matters exactly and who knows maybe one day \nyou'll become a bag collector too I guess so [Music] \nDo you take advantage of this? \ndo you take advantage of this \nhey guys do you ever use the knowledge you learned in college in your everyday life \nyes my major was in business so I use what I learned all the time in my job \nsame here I was a computer science major so I also use my programming skills \nevery day that's cool my major is history \nso I don't use much of what I learned in my current job that's okay it doesn't mean what you \nlearned wasn't valuable even if you're not using your degree in your job the Knowledge and Skills you \ngained are still important yes and who knows maybe someday you'll \nfind a job where your history degree is really useful yeah you're right thanks for reminding \nme of that I guess I should not worry too much and appreciate the education I received \nexactly education is always valuable no matter what field you go into \nright the more you know the more you can do thanks guys I feel better now \n[Music] moving to a new city \nMoving to a new city \nhey I heard you're moving to a new city that's exciting yeah it is but I'm also a little nervous \nabout it I've never lived anywhere else before don't worry I'm sure you'll do great \nwhat made you decide to move my job actually I got offered a great opportunity in the \nnew city so I couldn't pass it up that's awesome have you started looking for a place to live yet \nyeah I've been doing some research online but I haven't found anything that's suitable yet \nwell if you need any help just let me know I have friends in that City who might be able to support you \nthanks I really appreciate it it's nice to know I have people I can rely on during this transition \nof course moving to a new city can be tough but it's also an exciting Adventure \nI'm sure you'll love it [Music]
