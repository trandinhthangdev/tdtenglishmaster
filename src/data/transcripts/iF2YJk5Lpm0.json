\nwhere did you go on holiday [Music] \nI heard your family went out for Christmas yesterday honestly it's really an unforgettable \nholiday when I have the opportunity to strengthen the bond between family members \nso where did you go we went to a zoo near my house which is surrounded by Green Grass and trees and \nmany rare animals I took a lot of beautiful photos there \ngreat so what impressed you the most about that Zoo not only did I get to see the animals \nbut I also learned about their behavior and fed them I think zoos are important to raise \npeople's awareness about protecting nature as well as endangered species \n[Music] can't find my laptop \nI can't find my laptop. \nokay \nYuri what are you running so fast for oh my God Claire have you seen my laptop \nanywhere your laptop where did you leave it \nI remember I forgot it the school library while doing my homework but what I went back to look for it it \nwas nowhere to be found [Music] or if someone's stolen it already \nI'm not sure when I came back to class from the library I didn't see any forgotten computers \nit's a new computer my mom bought me for my birthday and I really needed to prepare my presentation this afternoon \nin the library there is a small building dedicated to storing lost items and taking care of personal belongings you \ncan go there to find it really how do I get there \nyou go to the block behind the library and turn right near the back gate of the school \nI see it thank you very much [Music] \nIs this seat taken?

\nmay I open the window [Music] \nthe room seems hot and stuffy yes that's summer now do you mind if I \nopen the window for a moment that will make the room more Airy but it's hot out if you open the window \nthe sun will shine in or do we close the windows while turning \non the fan or the air conditioner good idea it can cool the room in the \nfastest time should have been in the evening when the air is quite cool and pleasant \nwe should open the window to ventilate the room and during the day close the door to avoid stuffiness \nI get it I'll pay more attention so now where is the air conditioner \ncontrol device foreign [Music] \nTy [Music] \nWhat is your nationality? \nhello can I sit here okay this place is still empty are you a \nnew student you look so strange you must not be from here \nsince I am an international student I will study here for about two weeks thanks to the international student \nExchange program at the school really what's your nationality \non Vietnamese studying in an international associate University program \nI will learn about the educational program as well as the extracurricular activities here \nactually my mother is also Vietnamese my parents have been in the U.S for a \nlong time see you an American citizen yes if you feel the need I will help you \nget used to the educational program here sounds good thank you \n[Music] how do you go to work \nHow do you go to work? \nforeign [Music] \nAmanda why are you at work so early today I just moved to a new house which is \ncloser to the company really so how do you go to work \nbefore my house was quite far from the company so I used to go by train \nbut now I only need to walk about 15 minutes what about you what vehicle do you use \nmy house is about seven kilometers from here every day I ride a bicycle to \nexercise and at the same time enjoy the Riverside view in the early morning \nthat sounds good because using a bicycle will reduce the rate of traffic jams \nbefore if I went to work by car it would take half an hour to get to the company \nyes of course it helps the environment too [Music] \nwhat kind of book do you read please \nWhat kind of book do you read? \n[Music] Jenny do you also go to the library after school to look for references \nnot really I just want to find more books to expand my knowledge \nbut if I need to prepare for a project or presentation I just look for scientific materials \nwhat genre of books do you usually choose to read science books of course \nI'm majoring in biological research as well as genetic engineering so books \nin the genre will be very helpful what about you what books do you usually \nread I like soft skills books such as communication skills presentation skills \nlearning design sales they help me improve and promote the \nnecessary qualities in my future career [Music] \nDo you have any siblings? \ndo you have any siblings [Music] \nwhat happened Mary you don't look happy my brother broke my laptop by mistake I \nhad to take it in for repair all week and didn't turn in my homework on time \nwhat a Pity so how many brothers and sisters do you have \nI only have one younger brother but as you can see he is very naughty often breaks with things and is very stubborn \nI think he didn't mean to upset you maybe because he's quite hyperactive \ndo you have siblings Mart no I'm the only child in the family so \nit's quite literally at times actually I really want to have brothers and sisters in the house so that I can \nshare my thoughts and Sorrows for example yes you're right \n[Music] \nThat sounds fine. \nthat sounds fine [Music] \nwe're going to have a presentation on how to help students with disabilities in our school so where should we start \nin my opinion we need to start by giving an overview of people with disabilities to give more information to the whole \nclass then we'll talk about discrimination in schools and finally the solution \ndo we have to do a PowerPoint part I think we should that makes it easier \nfor the audience to follow the presentation and it's also convenient to summarize the main idea of the talk \nshould we make a short video interviewing some students in the school about this issue that will make the talk \nmore convincing sounds fun so let's get started \nKeep the change \nkeep the change \nWe're Here Disneyland in Los Angeles thank you how much do I have to pay \naccording to the meter on the car the fair is 45 do you have cash \nyes but at first I thought going to Disneyland would only take 15 minutes about 30 dollars \nyes but today because of the traffic jam I had to turn around the highway \nit took longer than going straight so the fair was also higher \nI'm not worried about the price I'm just afraid of being late for the appointment it's okay here you can keep the change \nthank you [Music] \nWhat did you think of it? \nwhat did you think of it \nwhat are you reading in June a very good storybook the story of a \nseagull and the cat who taught her to fly what is it about \nthat bird is caught up in an oil spill a dying seagull scrambles ashore to lay \nher final egg and lands on a balcony where she meets a big black cat \nthe cat promises the seagull to look after the egg and teach the baby goal to fly \nunbelievable so what do you think about this book not only is a race a feature of this \nbook but Luis Sepulveda also teaches that it's important to help those less fortunate than yourself \nvery interesting this story also condemns the misconduct \nof people which has a bad effect on nature and creatures humans really lack awareness and \npreserving nature I know right not only in the short term but also keeping in mind the long-term \neffects our actions have today can destroy their clean living environment \nIt makes no difference to me \nit makes no difference to me [Music] \nthere will be a presentation contest in French at the school club the judges will give a statement so that the \ncontestants are free to express their thoughts as long as they can convince the judges \nwhy are you so interested in this contest it seems it's only for members of the \nFrench Club yes but it is an opportunity for us to learn more from other excellent students \nespecially the skill of expressing ourselves in French it's up to you it's nothing special to \nme anyway I'm not good at French so I wouldn't understand anything if I went to see the \ncompetition you can ask Peter to come along maybe he'll enjoy it \nall right let me try it foreign \nI don't feel well today \n[Music] you don't look well Cindy what happened \nI'm not very well today I feel dizzy have a headache maybe because I couldn't sleep last \nnight not really you have a fever if you don't feel well you can ask the teacher to let \nyou go to the medical room to rest how are you feeling now \nI feel cold and tired I must have caught a cold maybe I can't continue studying \ntoday so I'll call my mom to pick me up okay if you're sick don't try to go to \nschool it'll only make it worse now go home and rest if you need to go \nto the hospital don't worry I will send you today's lesson yeah thank you \n[Music] that's what I had in mind \nThat's what I had in mind \n[Music] hi Emily do you remember next week is \nJudy's birthday oh I've forgotten \nI wanted it to be a surprise but I was still confused about choosing an eye candy birthday present for her \nat least see what kind of present should we prepare for Judy should we buy a new \nshirt I don't think so Dan bought her a new t-shirt anyway \nlast year we bought an eye candy snow globe for a present and Judy liked it \nnow I'm thinking about the CD but I'm never really sure what music she likes also we need to think about the cost \nwe need to consider Judy's hobby she is always writing letters so I find a pen will be useful \nsounds great so which colors are we going to buy well the purple and black ones aren't \nvery good they're too dark how about a gold color one I'm sure Judy \nwill like it when we get it for her that's what I had in mind \n[Music] did I make everything clear \nDid I make everything clear? \nforeign I did my best to prepare for the project \nin the last presentation but it seems like everyone didn't pay attention \nI've heard your presentation about the main ideas in the lesson are very specific and precise so I think the \nproblem lies in your presentation skills really you see what I said \nwhen giving a presentation you did not keep eye contact with the audience \nyou only focused on looking at the paper or at the information on the screen \nbut this talk is still long I can't remember all of it \nbesides when I spoke in front of the whole class I was so nervous and nervous \nthat I was afraid I would say the wrong thing it doesn't matter \nyou just need to cross out the main ideas you want to say in the presentation and then paraphrase them \nfor your friends to understand your speech is too long and it contains a lot of unimportant information \nso I easily fell asleep you know what I mean right \noh man thanks for your advice I'll pay more attention [Music] \nWhy don't you go to see the doctor? \nwhy don't you go see the doctor [Music] \nJenny why do you look so tired today I couldn't sleep last night so in the \nmorning I woke up late I didn't have time to prepare my book do you have frequent insomnia \nlately yes I often wake up in the middle of the night and it's hard to go back to sleep \nbecause I don't get enough sleep I feel very tired the next morning if you keep losing sleep so often it \nwill have a bad effect on your health why don't you go see the doctor \nI've been studying for the final exam lately so I don't have time to go to the hospital \nand I think this insomnia is caused by my stress from studying it'll be fine \ndon't underestimate it lack of sleep will greatly affect your study in class and also your test results \nokay I'm going to check it out today [Music] \nI'll have some whiskey, then \nI'll have some whiskey then [Music] \nAnna will you come to my house tomorrow it's my brother's birthday really that's great do you need my help \nwith anything I also want to buy the necessary decorations to decorate the house \nmy sister will come home from school at 5 PM so I have about three hours to prepare for the party so you just have \nto come and have fun but I can't just come and play what about the dishes for dinner \nfor dinner my parents decided to order food at a nearby restaurant to avoid having to worry about cooking \nI asked my parents to let me organize a barbecue party it will be interesting \nokay I'll have some whiskey then [Music] \nI would give my ears for it \nI would give my ears for it [Music] \nhi Sue do you have any plans when you graduate from high school I'm thinking about that all the time I \nhad to choose one field for my higher studies I wanted to study business but my \nparents forced me to join the non-medical Stream they had their own justification because \nthey knew about the opportunities and prospects in the field of non-medical Medicine \nyou can just study in your favorite field if you can do well at it I see business as a potential and promising \nindustry yes but I don't know how to choose \nyou can check out some blogs where students have shared their experiences about their decisions related to their \nhigher studies and their consequences you can ask for advice they can help you \nwith your capabilities strengths and weaknesses thank you I would give my ears for it \n[Music] that's the end of the video thank you \nfor watching remember to practice English every day to improve your skills \nwatch the video at least three times a week and repeat daily conversations to \nimprove your listening and speaking skills fast try to mimic the intonation and \npronunciation in the video to enhance your speaking fluency and pronunciation \ndon't forget to like share and comment on my video please subscribe to the learn English with Jessica channel to \nwatch more helpful videos \n"
