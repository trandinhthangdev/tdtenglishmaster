    "transcript": "Introduction \n[Music] \nhow much did we spend household expense is a very common topic \nregularly mentioned by family members let's watch the video to see how couples \nadjust their living expenses to fulfill a financial goal \nAdjust spending to save money \nadjust spending to save money \n[Music] \nhave you considered what i talked to you about yesterday about buying a house and \ngetting a new car yeah i have thought about this \nwe've been renting a house for a long time we also saved some money \ni think it's time for us to think about buying a house and getting a new car \nso what is the plan i did some research a house now costs around two hundred \nthousand to two hundred and fifty thousand dollars yeah i calculated \nafter setting aside an amount for a new car we will still have a savings of about \nfifty thousand dollars left if we get a mortgage for the rest in 15 \nyears the monthly mortgage payment will be about one thousand four hundred dollars \nwhat do you think it's okay honey but we will have to spend a lot more thoughtfully i checked \nmonthly expenses the other day and was shocked because of the money we spent to eat out at the restaurant \nyeah the amount i spend on coffee every day may add up a lot i think i'll buy a thermos flask to take \ncoffee from home my monthly expense for new clothes is also quite a lot \ni need to limit myself to one new clothing item a month only \n[Music] yes what other areas do you think we can \nalso cut back on not yet for now i think we should do some budgeting on monthly expenses \ni agree we'll know the fixed amount each month and then adjust the expense for the rest \nokay let's calculate together now [Music] \nFinancial planning \nfinancial planning to prepare for having a baby [Music] \nhoney there have been bills for this month already right does it cost a lot this month \nstill the same as last month have you paid yet \nyes i did while mentioning living expenses i want \nto discuss your budgeting for monthly expenses yeah go ahead i'm listening \nwe're planning to have a baby next year so i think from now on we should manage \nour expenses more tightly so that we can save some money to raise our children \nyeah you're right if we wait until next year to think about these savings i'm afraid it's a \nbit late yes i think from now on we should cut down on some unnecessary expenses in the \nhouse what do you think we can reduce for example \ni will limit the purchase of these unnecessary cosmetics and perfumes \nor you limit buying those new game consoles \ni knew you would mention my gaming devices i'm just trying to cut entertainment \ncosts we won't go out to eat let's eat from home from now on \nelse we'll travel far away only once a year \nother than that we should choose a closer place to reduce costs is that okay \neverything you say makes sense however i think it's better to find a way to \nearn more money instead of having to budget on everything like that \nof course that's the best way but it's easier said than done \nhow can we earn more now i will take on more projects and work part-time at home in the evenings or on \nweekends is it okay for you really but you'll be tired from working \nall week no worry i will try to make it right \nit's just that the time spent with you will be a little less what do you think \nokay i have no problem with that but don't take on too many projects either \nremember it's just for making a little extra money okay \nsure don't worry [Music] \nphrasal verbs for everyday life to speak

\ni don't think watching horror movies is a good idea yeah me neither \nit's not that i'm scared or anything i just think it's annoying to watch horror movies at the theater people scream \nreally loud i cannot focus on the movie at all \nwhat about watching a comedy movie there is a movie called the silly dog \nwhat is it about it is about a high school student and his dog who suddenly can talk it seems \npretty funny um a talking dog huh \nnot my type of humor what do you think mike i don't like comedy to be honest they \nare too fake sometimes what about action movies are there good ones available now \noh right i like action movies too there is the racing life \nit's about gangster teams racing against each other there are many thrilly driving and \nfighting scenes that sounds nice let's go watch this one \ni agree with you guys let's watch the racing life then it sounds really interesting \nalan and jack are talking about their favorite volleyball players they are arguing which player is better \n[Music] hey did you watch the volleyball \nnational league match last night it was jackal against red lions \nno i couldn't i had to do my homework last night how was it \nit was amazing the match was really intense until the last minute and of course my most favorite team red \nlions won in the most glorious way the last score was really great \noh man now i really want to watch the match i bet red lions will be the champion \nthis season they have performed excellently since the beginning no i don't think so \ni think my favorite team golden cat will be the champion they won last season and the team that \nwon last season continues to play this year there is no reason for them to lose \n[Music] no no no even though you were my best \nfriend and i always agree with what you think this i have to disagree with you \ndespite being a young team red lions is really strong they have some of the strongest young \nmembers on the team with their youth and strength they can absolutely defeat \ngolden cat \nwell i agree that red lions are physically strong but i think they lack in skills and experience \ngolden cat has much more experience and skills as they have played for a long time \nthey can surpass red lions with a good strategy well red lion's coach is really good \nhe has led a top brazilian volleyball team before he can lead red lions to the \nchampionship for sure i doubt that golden cat has better teamwork \nthe members are very close to each other and work together in perfect harmony \nyou know teamwork is the most important when it comes to volleyball right well i guess you were right \ngolden cat is at bigger advantage down but let's wait and see you can't predict \nanything when it comes to sports yeah i couldn't agree with you more \nsports is full of surprises that's why it's enjoyable to watch \nit is the weekend jess and her big sister anna are deciding what to do \njess wants to walk the dog to the park but anna wants to go shopping they discuss to make the final decision \n[Music] \nhey anna tomorrow is sunday and i am free i've done all my homework let's do \nsomething oh yeah i don't have any plans for

please not tomorrow i'm very tired \nthis week i just had tests after tests and now i only want some light-hearted \nactivities that don't require too much exercise or else i will pass out \nbut you don't want to hang out with lulu you don't love him anymore \ni just fed him a few hours ago besides we can walk him another time \nit's not like the park will disappear okay then what do you want to do then i \ndon't want to stay at home tomorrow let me think \nwhat about going shopping at the mall there will be air conditioners at the mall so it will be cool \ni need to buy some new clothes for

hit it several times it got \nback to normal it must be totally broken this time \nis this tv still in the warranty period dad i'm afraid not \nas far as i remember i bought it more than two years ago \nplease check the warranty document again just to be sure \nyeah let me find it [Music] \nfound it the warranty is over let me call customer service to see how \nmuch it will cost to fix it i'm afraid fixing the screen might be more expensive than buying a new one \nso could you see how much it costs for a new tv now there is many kinds of tv now \ndad just look for a tv of the same size or \na little bit bigger no need to be too modern yes \nwhat is the size of this tv i mean how many inches \n50 inches okay let me do some research please call and ask them for the fixing \ncost okay i will tell you later \nsure dad [Music] \nAir Conditioner \nthe air conditioner not working \njack why is it so hot i did turn on that air conditioner \nit's on why is it still so hot what's wrong with
