\nlaunch we will aim at young adults aged \n18 to 25 years old \nthey are familiar with using social \nmedia quick to adapt to changes and love \ntrying new \nthings so what kind of content are we \nthinking based on my research I suggest \nthat we focus on short catchy videos \nespecially the ones with influencers or \ncelebrities yes we should definitely \nconsider partnering up with popular \nYouTubers or ticktockers in the field we \ncould send out free samples to them and \nget them to introduce our new product \nthrough Tik Tok or \nInstagram \ndefinitely we can even run a contest on \nInstagram sounds interesting could you \ntell us more about this idea we will \nhold a contest on Instagram and \nencourage users to create content about \nour products functions or \nbenefits the winner with the most \nimpressive content will probably get a \ncash reward and gift vouchers \nsounds like a great \nidea after this meeting I'd like you to \nsend me a detailed draft of the contest
