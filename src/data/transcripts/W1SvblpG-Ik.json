\nerror that could completely offend \nsomeone cause misunderstanding \nor have people think you are stupid \nthat's why many people stick to using \nfamiliar simple words because they feel \nmore comfortable and confident with them \nyeah that does apply to me I tend to \nforget the new words I learn and often \nfind myself using the same basic \nvocabulary \nPam you're not alone in that struggle \nit's a common issue for many language \nlearners \nso how can I overcome this \none thing you can try is actively \nincorporating the new words into your \nconversations as soon as you learn them \nthat's true it sounds cliche but it \ntakes practice and repetition to \nintegrate new vocabulary into our daily \nconversations \nanother reason why some people struggle \nto speak English well is because they \nlearn it in a passive way \n[Music] \nabsolutely Chris I had a friend named \nSarah who struggled \ndespite having a good grasp of grammar \nand vocabulary \nI can relate to that Mike I've also \nfound myself falling into the Trap of \npassive learning at times \nwell active engagement is key to \nmastering any language \nMike how did you help Sarah overcome \nthis obstacle \nI encourage Sarah to participate in \nspeaking activities and practice \nconversations with native English \nspeakers \nthat's wonderful learning English should \ninvolve active

learning \nprocess \nI think you have to make a habit of \nstudying every day \nI agree to improve our English speaking \nskills \nyou just have to practice speaking as \nmuch as possible \nand it's also crucial to take a moment \nto think before we speak \nyou know try to use those new words that \nyou have learned \nokay who all says other methods for \nlearning English \nwell I often use an

beneficial to focus on \nlearning vocabulary within specific \ntopics \ncan you be more specific \nwell by honing in on specific themes we \ncan develop a more comprehensive \nunderstanding of related
