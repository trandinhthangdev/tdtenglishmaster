up my mind \ni guess we're different then \nFriends reunion \ndialog 5 friends reunion \ni'm so glad that we can finally meet up like this i feel like it's been forever right it's \nbeen so long we haven't met for what nearly a year \nhey what song is on you don't know this song i don't never heard it before but i like \nthe melody it's big bang's newest song if you \noh is it kpop yeah i hated kpop when i was in high school \nbut i must admit this song sounds pretty good yeah there are a lot of great k-pop songs \nyou should try listening to some hmm maybe i will give it a try by the way did you \nguys hear that kim just got engaged wait what came from our class in high \nschool yeah i saw her update on facebook her boyfriend just proposed to her yesterday \nand she also said she would get married this august wow i'm so happy for her i can't believe \nour friend is getting married i know right i'm happy for her as well \nshe told me she would send us all the invitations let's meet again at the wedding sure thing \n[Music] \nEating out or eating at home \ndo you like eating out or eating at home some people prefer to eat at restaurants \nother people like preparing and eating at home let's watch the following video it will \ntalk about the advantages and disadvantages of eating out and eating at home \nDialogue 1 Eating out or eating at home \ndialogue one do you like eating out or eating at home \n[Music] my friends and i are getting together \nfor lunch do you want to come with us i'm sorry but i don't like eating out \nso you like to eat at home right yeah i like to eat at home oh \nwhy i think it is cheaper and healthier to eat at home you can cook your favorite dishes with \nfresh ingredients but when you eat out you can experience many delicious and strange dishes \nthat are prepared by restaurant chefs everyone has different favorite dishes \nand restaurants may satisfy all tastes of their customers at home you can learn how to cook foods \nthat you and your family love and you can even cook dishes from around the world \nall recipes are available online eating at home is both nutritious and cheap it's not much cheaper \nwhy not when we eat at home we do the preparation cooking and serving of the food \nourselves and therefore do not need to pay the labor costs of cooks \nwaiters and other restaurant staff meals at restaurants cost two or four times more than meals \nprepared at home but i find eating at home troublesome \nyou will waste a lot of time cooking them i think eating out will be more convenient \ni needn't prepare and wash up afterward i think that i spend time with my family \nand my loved ones are really worth it family meal times are the perfect opportunity for the \nfamily to connect after eating everyone will help each other clean up \nsounds great food stand or fast food is very harmful to your health \nsome ready-to-eat foods have more oil salt and sugar than home-cooked food when you eat out you will eat more than \nusual because you tend to order more that will lead to obesity i think i \nshould manage my time to prepare meals you should [Music] \nDialogue 2 Invite friends to go to a new restaurant \ndialogue 2 invite your friends to go to a new restaurant where has many good reviews \nhi james hi lucy mary and i are having a plan for dinner do you want \nto come with us yeah that

restaurant one time fantastic i really want to \nenjoy it right now i've always wanted to try korean food have you tried korean food \ni've eaten out at several korean restaurants before but i think seal house offers something new \nreally what is it it serves traditional korean street food such as \nkimchi fries pajeon pancakes and korean fried chicken in mixed korean and english styles \nyummy

you have any preference for where you would like to go for dinner i don't really know where i want to go \ni'm having trouble thinking of a particular restaurant do you have any suggestions for me yeah \ni know a good restaurant about italian food it's also my favorite restaurant \nit's an authentic italian restaurant what's the name of the restaurant its \nname is mamma mia it's a small and cozy one they have been in business for over 30 years \nwhere is the restaurant restaurant is located on the top floor of the silver \nbuilding from the restaurant you can see the whole city the view of the city is breathtaking great \nwhat's the specialty the signature menu is pizza and pasta all made from the \nfreshest ingredients what is your favorite dish at the restaurant \nmy favorite food is pizza burrata it is also the restaurant's best seller dish \nwhat are its components it includes tomato sauce mozzarella cheese \nburrata and ham sounds really yummy you can also try a dish called peniel \nsalmon what is it it's the name of spaghetti with cylinder-shaped pieces \ni think that would be a really good choice i will call and make a \nreservation dream house mary \nis being interviewed by james about their dream house mary \ni would like to interview you about your dream house you only need to describe what is in \nyour mind while talking about this topic okay sounds good to me \nlet's start with your house and the environments around it shall we \ni'm ready just ask away what is your favorite kind of house \nit's a typical suburban house in america those ones that have a large backyard \nand two driveways leading to the front door and the garage \nthose houses that are messed produced by big construction companies that are similar to others nearby \ni'm imagining just that what is the main attractiveness of those \nhouses a neighborhood with little differences between the houses yet having their own \npersonality in my mind that kind of neighborhood sparks peacefulness and freedom \nit gave me a sense of belonging in a way wonderful and you have a very specific \nmindset and idea about the area around your home too so i'm curious what kind of neighbors \nwould you be comfortable living by neighbors let me think about that for a \nbit having a nice cat lady living nearby would surely be a great \nexperience young couples who have little kids would also attract my attention \nand what are the main reasons because little kids who are curious and \nenergetic are very cute and quite joyful to play with \ni'm an outgoing person so making new friends is one of the most exciting things in my \nlife and the reason why i like cat ladies is that i also am a cat lover too \nbut too busy to raise one myself besides \nold people are experienced so asking them for life advice from time to time is beneficial \ninteresting please go on what about the contrast \nwhat sort of person living in your neighborhood that you would not get along with \ntop of my list being toxic middle-aged men whose life goal is to bring \nsuffering to others can you be more specific when i was only \na kid there was a man living several houses away who was both mean and scary he was extremely hated \nby more than half of our neighborhood for his deeds i don't really want to recall so can we \nmove on of course let's focus more on your house \nthen how many rooms do you want it to have minimum preferably well my \nideal house should have at least two bedrooms a kitchen a separate dining room and a \nliving room i can use three or four bedrooms because later in time \nit can be put into great use and three bathrooms around the house \njust to be sure is there any specific reason for this lineup to be ideal mary \nwell one of the bedrooms would be for me and my future husband and the other is for my kids \nthe dining room to me should be separated from the living room simply because one is for family \ngatherings and the other is for having guests and recreation activities \nwhat about having three bathrooms i imagine one for each bedroom and the \nother is shared yes that is my original intention \nin my home the bathroom should be a personalized space that is filled with equipment \ndedicated to relaxation and self-care your mindset is fantastic by the way \ni rarely see anyone with such details thank you james i was raised in a \nwonderful my parents allow me to have my personal space and we cherish the family time we \nhave together my opened mindedness is also a gift from my mom \nvery cool by the way what are the things inside your dream home \nthat deprived you of your childhood home well firstly the personal bathrooms and \nthe separation between the dining room and the living room secondly is the type of house in \nneighborhood i lived in the suburban area in my younger years for the familiarness \nto that area stuck with me so how does your dream house differentiate itself from your childhood \nhouse the paint is the first thing that comes to mind \ni want my dream house to be bright and kind of colorful \nsky blues and sea blues would definitely cover most of my front along with a white and light \ngreen doorway the garage might as well be a deep blue \nbut anyway that's my only current thought how about the inside there are a lot of \nchoices so i can't decide yet the range of choices is simply endless \nisn't it that's right so maybe later in time i will know more \nprecisely okay that's okay so what about the \nfurniture where would you want me to start the \nliving room and dining room are some good starters i'm particularly fond of long sofas \nand utilized couches those couches can have multiple things you see \na round central table with glass tops and drawers very child friendly some cupboards and \ndrawers pressed against the walls a tv attached to the wall at eye level \nand loudspeakers i would love to be able to hear the music that comes from those speakers \nwhen i'm cooking in the kitchen everything else is optional such as decorations and \nrecreational stuff how about the dining room furniture \ntwo more cupboards to display and store kitchen and eating stuff such as plates and bowls \na small electrical furnace in case it got chilly along with a collection of scene candles \nyou were also fond of scene candles oh recently i was introduced to this \nwonderful stuff by one of my roommates electric scene makers are great but are nowhere \nnear as sensational a great point there anything else \na chandelier maybe i found those crystally ones are \nfabulous but not very suitable for a low ceiling house \nbut that will go into consideration later apart from that a robot vacuum cleaner \nand one of those alexas who will be a nice touch to the house \ngoing modern aren't you i want my dream to be house to be as modern as possible but i \nhaven't gotten enough knowledge about it but in the future the list will definitely be longer \nhow about your bedroom i would rather not talk about it yet you see i will share \nmy bedroom with my future husband so i don't want to think about it yet \nthat will be a later discussion between me and him it's the same for the bathrooms i \nunderstand is there anything that makes your dream kitchen special to you \nif i have the financial capability i want my kitchen to be equipped with \nall the basic utilities along with luxurious stuff i'm talking about masterchef level of \nfurniture i'm a self-taught cooker but it doesn't stop me from going pro \nfascinating so thank you for allowing me to carry out \nthis interview with you it has been a great pleasure listening to you i've got so much meaningful \ninformation from you thank you james i hope to talk \nto you later in the future goodbye \ni used to dialogue one what did your parents look like when \nthey were children [Music] \nmom what did you look like when you were young is it different from now i think it's a

convenience and the variety of choices watch the video and see how different \npeople buy essential things on the internet \ndialog one [Music] [Applause] \nhello taylor oh hi veronica what are you doing nothing just enjoying \nthe fresh air great well i have a favor to ask you \nwhat is it i'm going to a wedding this weekend and i'm thinking of buying this dress \nonline really yes so i need your opinion \nbecause you shop online a lot and you're a fashion expert \nthank you for the compliment uh show me the dress then here it's on amazon \noh it's very cheap that's why i chose it you can never get a dress like this at a \nstore with such little money but it seems like it doesn't fit your \nbody type well i thought that the details are beautiful \nyou have a small and nice waist meanwhile this dress doesn't even have a waistline but i can \nalways use a belt to fix that no a belt doesn't go well with a \ndress like this i like it but it's not the perfect one for you \nwhat a pity you i thought i would look nice in it \na lot of people think that when they buy something online and then they get disappointed that's \nthe disadvantage you can't try it on first \nright but online shopping is more convenient when you go to into the stores if one \nshop doesn't have what you need and you have to go to another you're right but let's find another one \nscroll down what about this one it can fit you well \nbut check the review first okay the comments aren't so positive they say \nthat delivery is slow and the fabric is too thin understandable the price is way too low \ndoes this red one look pretty to you no it's too sparkly it's going to make \nyou look ridiculous well check this blue one \nseems good it's quite simple but formal enough for a wedding people love this one too although it's a \nlittle more expensive quality clothes online are usually expensive \nbut it's okay i can afford it thank you for your help taylor you're welcome have fun at the wedding \n[Music] \ndialogue two \nmark have you heard the news i haven't had time why they said that all stores will be \nclosed from tuesday that's the day after tomorrow right \nyes oh boy i bet it's because of the pandemic \nindeed that's the only reason what do we do now we don't have that \nmuch food left in the fridge the worst thing is that we don't know \nwhen they will open again our dorm should have had a canteen \nwell the pandemic was unexpected after all but i heard that we can buy groceries \nonline are you serious of course since the pandemic a lot of people have \nopened grocery stores online i don't know the idea of buying meat or \nvegetables on the internet seems weird to me but that's the only way mark is right \nwe don't have another choice besides usually we still buy frozen meat and \npackaged vegetables at the supermarket yes there's not much difference \nfine but we have to find a reliable shop true that's the most difficult part also \nknown as the number one drawback of online shopping does anyone have experience britney \nmight she's the one who suggested the idea actually no i just saw some people talk \nabout it on twitter can you call your mom or dad to ask \nright they probably know in my home country there are very few cases the \nshops are still running let me call arizona might be in lockdown \nwell then you do it it's true my mom said that the shops there have \nbeen closed for almost a week oh that's really bad it is but the \nfridge at my home was quite full of course it is however my mom \nprepared for everything she already had some shops that we can \nbuy from that's great well she told me that she's going to send them to me later \nso problem solved \ndialogue three [Music] \nmom i want to buy a pair of shoes shoes why so sudden well \ni'm about to go back to school and my converse are too old already \noh yes they are but i want to try and buy them online \nreally i'm not so sure about that why it's more convenient and there are a \nlot more options what if you buy a pair and they don't fit that would be a waste of money \nthen we can just return it back to the shop how do you know that they will let you do that i'll just ask them through \nmessages all right that's fine enough great can you help me look \nsure [Music] so i've been liking this pair of boots \nfor a while so long they nearly reach your knees \ni know but it looks really cool don't you think so yes but they're super inconvenient they \nmight take you five minutes to put them on wait five minutes yes \nputting your feet into them properly can already be a struggle plus i don't think it's appropriate for \nschool then what do you think is appropriate sneakers perhaps i've always warned them \ni need a change well you can find a pair of simpler boots \nankle boots yes with a zipper so that it's easy to put on \nthen have a look at this white pair so expensive that's over ninety dollars but they're \ngerman if the quality is good i can wear them for a long time \nthere are quality boots at a cheaper price you know let me look a little more how about \nthis fifty dollars not much cheaper but acceptable \npeople's reviews say that it's worth the money okay but ask the shop if you can return \nit if it doesn't fit we can after that they will deliver a similar pair \nin different sizes good then order it \nfinished when will they be delivered well maybe in five days or sooner i hope \n[Music] \ntalk about your favorite drink situation one isabella asks maria to go \nto a pub with her it's maria's first time so isabella and dave the bartender recommend her \ntheir favorite drinks hi maria it's isabella hi isabella what's up \nthere is a new pub downtown and i wanted to ask if you want to go check it out with me tonight \na pup sure but i haven't been to a pub before i'm kinda nervous don't worry \ni got you and the bartender will help you choose the drink that fits your taste \nso i'll meet you there at 8pm is that fine sure see you then bye \nlater \n[Music] hey maria over here \nhi girls what can i help you with today hi i don't know what to order can you \nhelp me with the menu sure here \ni highly recommend this drink whiskey sour it's a bourbon-based cocktail a \ncombination of whiskey sugar and lemon juice it's my all-time favorite \ni want something fresher how about a mojito this classic cuban cocktail \nfeatures a combination of citrus sweet and mint flavors to control the strong taste of rum \nbut i think it especially is enjoyable on a hot summer day at the pool \nmaria how about long island iced tea you like iced tea right for those who \nlove iced tea this long island-based drink is even better it may look like a regular glass of tea \nbut a mixture of vodka rum tequila gin triple sec and cola can give \nit a strong taste or you can try lemon drop it is the \nperfect combination of sweet and sour garnished with a fun and colorful lemon twist \nand sugar around the rim of the glass for extra sweetness it's my favorite drink they both sound \ntasty but i want to see other options what does this bloody mary taste like \nthis popular and complex beverage can be as spicy or mild as you like flavorings such as \ntabasco sauce worcestershire sauce and cayenne pepper \ncan be added according to your preferred taste that's interesting i think i will try \nthe spicy bloody mary please great choice you will love it \nthis is fun right we should do this more often sure i'll try to other drinks next time \n[Music] situation two karen takes her daughter \nolivia to a fair there is a booth that sells drinks for kids karen helps olivia choose her drink \nlook mom over there what olivia \nlook at those drinks so colorful mom can i have one please \nsure honey come on

had one of those creamsicles from the ice cream trucks in the summer this smoothie tastes just like that it's \nvery sweet and citrusy and creamy and altogether refreshing \nlike summer in a glass wow

chris natasha and rose are talking about their favorite \nseason and the conversation slowly turned into a discussion \nwatch the video to see at the end which season do they all like most \nguys i'm wondering which season is the best season of the year \nin my opinion i like winter the most seriously you're from a tropical country \nnatasha i thought you can't bear the low temperature in winter here \nwell to be fair the reason why i love winter here is that i'm from a \ntropical country in the past i had never seen snow \nnever got to wear many layers of clothes and definitely never celebrated \nchristmas wait your family never celebrated christmas before \nbut you guys do now yes it's hard not to with such a joyful and \nfestive atmosphere it has become one of the holidays that i look forward to the most \ni have a different point of view i prefer autumn i love the cool breezy weather \nit gives me a really peaceful vibe we all know you get too excited when the \nseason comes oh really just the thought of sitting \nbeside the window with a cup of tea and watching the leaves falling down already warms my heart \nso much i think autumn is quite great too \nnot as amazing as winter of course but i love drinking pumpkin latte and halloween is \nalways so fun here you're absolutely right pumpkin lattes \nat starbucks are the best but autumn is like a signal that the school \nyear is going to start soon so i don't like it i prefer summer \ni have tons of free time to go wherever i want to actually we all kind of enjoy summer \nwhether we like it or not right trips summer fruit the sun shines \nevery day even sudden summer rains are beautiful i just love everything about it \nbut the days when it's too hot ugh i can't handle that \ni sweat easily so summer sometimes annoys me \nwell every season has their own drawbacks but to me the hot weather it's not such \na big deal i still love it when summer comes seems like we all have different \nopinions about this unlike you guys i'm a spring person \nwow really i've always thought that you were a winter like me \nno winter is too cold for me i hate it when i can't go out just \nbecause it's too cold or snowy when spring comes the weather gets warmer \nand it's also the time when lots of flowers bloom everything in spring is just pretty and \nlively to me spring is kind of a boring season \ni don't really see something specific or unique about it i don't think so spring is the first \nseason of the year which means it's a new beginning it motivates me to neglect \nall the bad things that happened in the previous year move on and try to be better \nthat sounds really inspiring yes my brother told me that once \noh speaking about siblings my brother is coming back to america tonight \nreally i'm so happy for you he's been gone for so long \nthank you we're going to pick him up at the airport so i think i should go home \nit's also a bit late now yeah let's all go home we will continue this \ndiscussion tomorrow goodbye guys [Music] \nu.s treasuries ticked higher as equity investors screwed through the sidelines after several tech companies slashed \ntheir outlooks and revived them hello grandma world economy at close of business good evening \nyou've just gone out with your friends rose 1.7 yes grandma did you have fun \nof course i did we went to a cafe shop and we just talked and enjoyed our drinks \nsounds nice what did you talk about well we were just discussing our \nfavorite season of the year but it was more like deciding on which season \nis the absolute best season oh how cute do you have a favorite \nseason grandma me no \nyou see when you've reached my age the season is just another name for a time \nlife goes on and you live without noticing which season it currently is i have more \nimportant things that i need to think about that's deep i mean the season is just \nanother name for time part yes so i don't really have a favorite \nseason i also don't think that there's something about a particular season that \nmakes me like it more than the others at least at the moment \nbut you must have had one when you were young right i think i did i was always excited for \nsummer to come wow really my friend chris likes summer \ntoo so what makes him like this season \nwell he said that summer gives him plenty of time to go hang out with friends to travel he loves the summer heat and \nthe light from the sun too what about you grandma what i love about summer is that it's \nunpredictable today might be a breezy and bright day but tomorrow it might be \nrainy and cloudy it shows how magical nature can be and i used to be in awe of \nthat but isn't it that unpredictability \nannoying sometimes i mean what if you're playing with your friends and it suddenly reins \ni was 10 at the time rose i loved showering in the rain \nas a kid getting wet because of the rain or because of the sweats wasn't that big \nafter all you didn't have anyone to stay impressed for \nyou may be right the reason why you like a season can speak a lot about your \npersonality too you know people know how unpredictable the weather and summer \nis but you rarely find someone that likes summer because of that \nbut it's my reason and your grandpa used to say that that means i tend to appreciate things \nthat people don't really care much about oh now when i think about it it's so \n[Music] true \n[Music] good morning guys hello \nlet's sit down the weather is really nice today see summer can have cool days too \noh you remind me about our conversation yesterday chris should we continue yes \nwe still haven't decided which season is the best one yesterday i told my grandma what we \ntalked about and she said something really interesting what is it she said that the reason why \nyou like a season can speak a lot about your personality wow i haven't really thought of that \nbefore but it seems true i love summer because i can travel everywhere \nand i'm a very active person i can't stay in one place for too long \nthat's right i thought about it too and i like autumn because it gives me a \npeaceful vibe i'm an introvert i prefer quietness and i love being on my own \nit's really a perfect match rob loves spring because it's a new \nbeginning so i guess that means he's someone who always moves forward and very excited for the future \noh my god that's so true what about me you like winter because \nyou can layer clothes watching the snow fall and celebrate christmas with your family right \n[Applause] that's true well then i think you're \njust a person who really enjoys life you like sceneries you care about the way you dress \nand you love being with your family a girl with a very put together lifestyle in my opinion \nyeah that seems like me even though i've never thought that highly of myself but my \nfriends and relatives sometimes said the same thing you did you know what i think the best season \ndoesn't exist after all i mean it's difficult to find a similar advantage between \nall seasons and even if we can find it i don't think every single person will agree i think \nthe same people have different opinions and that's completely fine what's really important is that we live \nlife to the fullest and try to find the good in every phase of the year \neven in a time we don't really like wow that's a very mature thought i can't \nagree more me too [Music] \ntalking about becoming a dad bob asked his dad jay for advice \nsince he will become a dad for the first time next month \ndad are you free now yeah i'm just reading a newspaper \nto be honest i'm quite nervous now why can you tell me \nwell my wife is pregnant in the 34th week and the due date is coming soon \ni'm so excited to meet my baby in person not by frame but i'm not sure how to be \na good father um i got it i understand your feeling \nactually i used to be too how did you take care of sarah and

sacrifice your time for your children you can't hang out with your friends \nevery weekend you can't go to the gym once a day you need to stay home \nand help your wife because the schedule of a baby is different from an adult how is that \ndifferent it depends on each stage of their life \ngenerally they eat at least five times per day until over two years old and they can't go to \nthe toilet by themselves until four you're scaring me dad \nit's fine not to hang out with my friends but i must go to the gym and i'm sure my wife's ability to feed \nour boy five times per day alone you know your mom and i almost got \ndivorced when you were born i used to think like you that the wives can take care of children by themselves \nbecause they directly gave birth i made many excuses to go out for not \nhaving to hear you cry then your mother was depressed and we couldn't stop arguing \nhow did you overcome that period your grandfather helped me to realize \nhow selfish i was you know after giving birth women's health is not as good as \nbefore they have to sacrifice all their time to be my children's side they still \ndo all the housework while our life has no change we need to take responsibility to take \ncare of the child you're right since my wife was pregnant she's been tired at night and recently \nshe can't tie up her shoelaces it's just the beginning somehow we can't

with mark \nevery afternoon and go to the market with leila on the weekends \nthanks to them i started to learn how to be a dad actually it's not that difficult when we love someone from the bottom of our \nhearts and i do love them as much as i love you \noh sweetheart you are so wonderful \nback in the day you asked me about my favorite things about layla and mark you even wrote it down \ncarefully then you learned to cook sashimi for mark and kit a woolen scarf for \nlayla at first they didn't care at all but i know if i keep taking care of them sincerely \nthey will love me back

didn't know it was \njust a coincidence really do you think i would believe it \nwas just a coincidence okay peter i admit that i still have \nsome feelings left for jack but i swear this is all just a coincidence \nthere has been nothing between me and jack since he moved in since when sharon since when have you \nstarted lying to me like this i am not lying to you peter i never have \nyou dare blame me when you are part of the reason as well oh so now you are blaming me \nis it my fault that your college sweetheart moved here no i don't mean that peter i am saying \nthat you have been

it's hard to forget you just like that but i am trying \nif you would come into my life at a different time before sharon maybe then we could have \nhad a chance at being together you were really an amazing woman \nthanks jack i am truly happy for you and sharon after so much time apart you two are \nfinally going to get each other back i hope you two will have a happy ending \noh i am not getting ahead of myself this is only the start sharon just broke up with peter and we \nare both still very unsure it's okay just keep it natural if alice \nwere here she would say that oh alice i miss her jokes and pranks \ni know right she always has something to say and knows how to make everyone laugh \nwe miss everybody even peter in his practicing voice \nbut it was so terrible that our eardrums almost exploded i know but i'm used to living like that \nby the way how are things between you and peter we had a long conversation he said it \nwasn't entirely my fault he realized he was too focused on work \nand ignored sharon's feelings and needs meanwhile i was always there for her \ninstead of him i guess it's for the best anyway it's \nquite late i should get going oh i'm going

cooking not bad at all \nto the guy who makes my heart melt what who wrote this is this a prank \nfocus edward think okay so anne set up this table \nshe must be the one who wrote this then i'm so confused \nso i am filming myself because i am going through a weird situation right now \nand my housemate just left me this message it might not be her but she set this \ntable up so who else can it be right i am unsure because she is \nnormally really shy she got really annoyed the last time i filmed her without her permission \nanyway i find this so cute of her very interesting indeed \nbut i also am confused about what to do because this has never happened to me before \nhelp give me some suggestions should i ask her out on a date or something \ncan you turn the camera off i'm not comfortable being filmed edward edward excuse me why are you \nlooking at me like that no nothing sorry i am just a bit tired \nwhatever see you later remember wait for alice \noh i will see you later anne okay \nso that was her did you guys hear that she acted as nothing happened my little \nshy girl anne how interesting i'm pretty sure she has feelings for me by now \nshe definitely does or else

video to continue following the love story of edward alice and ann \n[Music] \njack wait up can i ask you for some advice sure what do you need advice on \nthere is this girl who secretly confessed her feelings to me through a piece of paper \ni don't really know what to do right now talking about girls aren't we well \ni am happy to inform you that you have asked the right person i'm an expert in love related matters \nhaha sure man anyway she even acted as nothing happened afterward \ni didn't expect it at all but i realized that i am also quite interested in her the \nmoment i saw her confession what should i do first of all she wrote \nher confession down on a piece of paper yes yes that's right with a delicious \nhomemade lunch as well it was so cute hmm so she must like that kind of thing \nyou know being secretive and all why don't you do the same to her \ni don't understand how do i do that exactly you are really clueless aren't you let's \nsee you must act mysterious for example you can send her a \nhandwritten message yourself surprise her invite her out for dinner or ask her to go see a movie with you \nsing her a song oh by her roses girls are definitely into that \nthat makes sense but do you think that might be too cheesy \ncheesy that is exactly what is going to win her over man you just gotta do it \ni am not quite sure if that is the case with this one but thank you for the advice i really \nappreciate it no problem let me know if you need anything else remember \ni am an expert in this yes i will remember that thank you \nflowers check i should put it here on this table the camera is set up the card next to \nthe flowers awesome all good i wonder if anne would like this ah \nlet's just give it a go dear anne roses are red \nviolets are blue sugar is sweet and so are you my lovely anne \nwould you be willing to join me tomorrow night to hang out i will be waiting for you in the living \nroom when everyone is asleep there will only be the two of us from your secret admirer \nokay this should do it jack is at the gym and won't be home for another two \nhours alice is out somewhere and is going to be home the earliest \nso she should be the one getting this message perfect hello is there anybody home \noh i need to go anyway what was i talking about \nyes sure see you then why suddenly someone in this house likes \nflowers what is this a card oh wow this is for \nme dear anne roses are red violets are blue \nsugar is sweet and so are you my lovely anne would you be willing to \njoin me tomorrow night to hang out i will be waiting for you in the living room when everyone is asleep \nthere will only be the two of us from your secret admirer \ntomorrow night huh ah this is so sweet the poem is really cute \ntoo hmm but who wrote this \ncan it be jack no way probably not but who else can it be then a \nstranger it must be jack then oh my god \ni can't believe this he finally changed his mind i'm so happy \nhello anne hello my lovely little sister \nmade you so happy anne you seem really excited today oh yes i'm very happy indeed i got a \nsurprise it was so romantic you won't believe it if i told you then tell me

and edward any update and i regret giving him that card so much \nwhat happened nothing that is the problem he is acting like nothing ever happened \nlike he did not read it what if he didn't no i'm sure he did i \nlooked for the note afterward but i couldn't find it anywhere well did you ask him \nabout it yes i asked him about lunch he only said \nhe was really happy with it and nothing else can you believe it hmm \nmaybe he needs to focus on something else right now either that or he really doesn't like me \ni guess i just need to accept it don't be so discouraged i think you should \ntell him directly it is better that way you can convey your emotions to him and show him that \nyou are really sincere maybe that is better than a card you know \nwhat if he likes you but does not like the way you confess your feelings no way in hell that is so stupid and \nembarrassing i will never do that up to you [Music] \nis someone here why is it so dark anne my girl i'm so glad that you
