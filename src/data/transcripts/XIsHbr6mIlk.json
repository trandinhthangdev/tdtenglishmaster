\nthe arm length in all the t-shirts is \ntoo short for me \ni have a similar problem \nwhen i buy trousers and find a pair the \ncorrect length the waist size is too big \nyou are very tall \nhave you tried some of the other stores \non the high street \nyes but the quality is not as good as \nhere \ni recently bought a cardigan and the \nsleeves ended just below the elbow \nthe salesperson said it was the fashion \nto have sleeves that length \nwell i suppose i could buy a blue shirt \nand tell everyone it is the latest \nfashion \nand have the shorter sleeves \nyes \nand it will allow your bracelet to be \nseen and not hidden by a long sleeve \nthanks \ni'll buy the blue t-shirt \n[Music] \nthanks for watching \ndon't forget to like share \ncomment on my video \nplease subscribe to
