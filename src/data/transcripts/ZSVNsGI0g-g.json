going on my parents are very \nconservative they always complain about how I dress don't let me go out with friends at night and even force me to \ntake extra courses so do you normally spend time with your \nfamily I see you go out all the time no every time I go home there is an \nargument I prefer to chat with my friends I think everything your parents \ndo is to want the best for you after all family is always the \nsafest place but maybe because they haven't \nunderstood your wishes yet they can't properly care you should talk to your parents \ntake care of your family everything will get better thank you I'll \n[Music] try he \nTeacher \nteacher who are you preparing gifts for for my piano teacher today is her \nbirthday you seem to really like your teacher you've told me about

her I have improved a lot I have a music talent show coming up \nsoon and I'll try to practice so that I don't disappoint her \nI think that is the most meaningful gift for her hope you will achieve your goals \nand get high marks on the [Music] \nBooks \nexam \nbooks we need to find a good book to introduce to the class next week any \nideas I think we should choose the story of a seagull in the cat who taught her \nto fly what is it about caught up in an oil spill a dying \nseagull scrambles ashore to lay her final egg and lands on a balcony where \nshe meets a big black cat ah I seem to have heard about that \nthe cat promises the seagull to look after the egg and teach the Baby G to \nfly yes it's a meaningful story that teaches us it's important to help those \nless fortunate than ourselves the story also condemns human wrongdoing that has a negative impact on \nnature and species I know accidentally destroying their clean \nliving environment just for the sake of short-term \nprofit \nAnimals \nanimals Last Summer I got a chance to visit the zoo with my family in order to see different species of \nanimals great that place must be interesting right the view was so \nbeautiful that we took many photos there I also want to go to the zoo with my \nfamily everyone in my family loves animals my sister and I took pictures \nwith tigers lions leopards and also hippos among all the animals that I saw \nhippos were the ones that gave me the most impression really how are they they were \nmuch bigger than I had expected at the same time they are incredibly cute as I caught them shaking \ntheir bodies in a lovely way after getting out of the water sounds interesting I think I will \nask my parents to go there all the weekend \nTravel \n[Music] travel Lisa where

\nmonuments ah I know that's the mountain that boasts the carved faces of Four \nAmerican Presidents every year about 3 million visitors visit the \nmountain where they can Trek the presidential Trail for a closeup look at the massive \nfaces I still wonder how they can sculpt such beautiful faces right on the \ncliff apparently it was completed in 1941 when the project was completed by \nsculptor
