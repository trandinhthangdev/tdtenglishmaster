\nto learn but part of the fun is just \ndoing it i mean it doesn't need to be \nperfect \n[Music] \nmaybe i'll give it a try \nyou should \nand it's a great way to deal with stress \nactually i

and i \ndidn't see my chances of advancing in \nthe company \nthat makes sense a job without \nopportunities and a difficult boss isn't \nvery attractive \n[Music] \nexactly so anyway i decided to quit and \nfind a new job \n[Music] \ni sent out my resume to more than 20 \ncompanies \nunfortunately i've only had two \ninterviews so far \nhave you tried looking online for a job \nyes but so many
