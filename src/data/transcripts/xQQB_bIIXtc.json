    "transcript": "Intro \n[Music] I wonder how it \nI wonder how it feels \nfeels Alice this Art Gallery is amazing I've never seen so many beautiful \npaintings in one place I know Brian I love coming here \neach painting tells its own unique story like this one here the colors are \nso vibrant it seems seems so lifelike a that's one of my favorites \nthe artist captured the emotions so well I wonder how it feels to touch it \nseems like the paint would still be wet please don't touch that the oils \nfrom your skin can damage the painting I'm so sorry Alice I wasn't \nthinking it's okay just be careful this art is priceless thanks for understanding I \nreally should be more mindful in places like this it's a learning experience \njust remember to look with your eyes not your hands definitely and thanks for bringing \nme here Alice I've learned a lot today not just about art but also \n[Music] etiquette he is not my \nHe is not my father \n[Music] father Emma I saw you with that man at the cafe yesterday was that your dad Oh \nyou mean Robert no he's not my father I just assumed because you two \nlooked so close my apologies it's a common mistake he's actually my mom's boyfriend they've been \ndating for a few months now oh I see how do you feel about that I mean it must be \ndifferent having someone new around honestly it's been hard I miss my \nmy dad and seeing my mom with someone else is strange I can't imagine how that feels \nif you ever need to talk I'm here for you thanks Jake it means a lot Robert is \na nice guy but he's not my father time will tell maybe things will \nget easier as you get to know him better I hope so but for now I'm just taking it \none day at a time \nDid you talk to him? \ndid you talk to [Music] \nhim Rachel you won't believe who I saw at the mall yesterday oh who was it you remember \nDanny from high school the one with the loud fashion sense oh my gosh yes the one who used to \nwear those flashy shoes what was he doing here shopping I guess \nbut get this he was wearing a pink fur coat I've never seen anything like \nit no way that's so Danny always trying to stand out \nhuh exactly it was so over the top I couldn't help but stare did you talk to him I wanted to \nbut he was surrounded by a group of people probably his new Entourage or something well something never \nchange Danny being the center of attention is one of [Music] \nthem you had me worried for a \nYou had me worried for a moment \nmoment Lisa have you seen my new watch I've looked everywhere and can't find it \noh the silver one you bought last week I haven't seen it since you showed it to \nme I'm getting really worried it was quite expensive and it has sentimental \nvalue I can imagine let's retrace your steps where did you last remember having \nit I think I was in the kitchen making coffee this \nmorning then I went to the living room and after that the \nbedroom okay let's start in the kitchen maybe it's somewhere \nthere found it it was under the morning newspaper silly me you had me worried \nfor a moment I'm just glad it's safe and sound thanks for helping me look Lisa I \nreally appreciate \nit I've heard a lot about \nI've heard a lot about them \nthem Jenna have you ever been to an escape room before no no I haven't but I've heard a \nlot about them why do you ask Well I booked one for us tonight a \nmystery themed one I thought it could be a fun way for us to hang out wow that's unexpected but it sounds \nexciting what do we need to do we'll be locked in a room and we have to solve \npuzzles and clues to get out we have 60 Minutes to escape that sounds \nchallenging but I'm up for it I've always Lov mystery games great I hope you're ready for \naction this is one of the top rated Escape rooms in the city with you by my \nside I'm sure we'll make a great team and solve the mystery let's do this absolutely let's give it our best \nshot and have a [Music] \nblast it's a different \nIt's a different story \nstory [Music] hey Alex I heard you went to that new \nband's concert last night how was it oh Jess don't even get me started the \nconcert was a real disappointment really I've heard their \nsongs on the radio and they seemed pretty good the recordings are fine but live \nit's a different story how was it the lead singer was off key and the \nsound system was terrible oh no that's such a shame and you were looking forward to it \nso much I know I even bought their merchandise now I regret it maybe give \nthem another chance in the future perhaps it was just an off night for them I'll think about it but for now I'm \njust trying to forget the wasted money and time I understand next time let's go \ntogether we can make sure it's a band we both know and love sounds like a plan \nJess thanks for [Music] \nunderstanding I made breakfast for [Music] \nI made breakfast for her \nher hey David you look a bit down today what happened it's about Anna this morning \nshe was very irritated with me oh no what was it \nabout I made breakfast for her trying to surprise her you know but she said I \nshould have asked her first as she had already \neaten that's tough but maybe she just wasn't expecting it and didn't know how \nto react I thought I was doing something nice I just wanted to make her day \nbetter it's the thought that counts David maybe just talk to her and explain your \nintentions I'll try I just hate it when we have misunderstandings like this \nmoments like this happen it's how you handle them that matters give her some time then talk thanks Ryan I'll do just \nthat I appreciate the \nadvice it was insanely bad \nIt was insanely bad \nhey Emma I saw your Instagram that you went to that new Italian restaurant downtown how was it Mike I don't even \nknow where to begin it was insanely bad what \nseriously but it looks so Fancy from the outside that's what I thought too but \nthe service was slow and when the food finally came it was cold and tasteless \noh no that's awful did you say something to the staff I tried but they seemed \nindifferent it's like they didn't even care about the customers that's a big red \nflag thanks for letting me know I was actually considering taking my family there next \nweekend oh I'd reconsider if I were you there are so many better places \naround definitely taking your advice on this one thanks Emma anytime Mike just looking out for a \n[Music] friend he's more than \nHe's more than good \n[Music] good hey Claire I heard you were working \non the new marketing project with Paul how's that going Jake it's been a roller coaster I \nmean the project itself self is challenging but working with Paul is something \nelse really I always thought Paul was an expert in marketing isn't he good at \nwhat he does oh he's more than good he knows it inside out but he's just so intense he \nwants everything to be perfect ah I see what you mean \nperfectionists can be tough to work with sometimes exactly I mean I appre \nappreciate his expertise but sometimes I just wish he'd loosen up a bit well \nmaybe you can find a way to balance things out you know bring a bit of lightness to the team I'll try Jake it's \njust a matter of finding the right approach with him hang in there Claire I'm sure you'll figure it out thanks \nJake I appreciate the \nencouragement does it make a big \nDoes it make a big difference? \n[Music] difference Mandy did you hear about the \nchanges in the company's software yeah Thomas I heard something about it during lunch they're updating \nthe interface right exactly and they're integrating some new tools as well I \nthink it's supposed to help with our daily tasks but does it make a big difference \nI mean the old software was working just fine well management seems to think so they \nbelieve it will increase our efficiency by at least 20% 20% that sounds dramatic but I hope \nthe transition is smooth learning new software can be a pain I share your \nconcerns Mandy but there's going to be training sessions for all of us so that should help I hope so I just don't want \nour work to get disrupted too much we'll get through it together just take it one \nstep at a time thank thanks Thomas I appreciate your \noptimism time is more valuable than \nTime is more valuable than money \nmoney hey Alex how was the weekend trip to the mountains it was amazing Jake but I had \nto take an unpaid leave to go on that trip my boss wasn't too happy about it \nI've always told you to prioritize your well-being over work sometimes a break is what we need but Jake I lost money by \ntaking that leave and now you know how tight things have been for me lately Alex always remember time is more \nvaluable than money you can always earn more money but you can't get back time \nonce it's gone I never looked at it that way maybe you're right the moments I \nspent in the mountain away from The Daily Grind they were \nPriceless that's the spirit work is important but so is living in the moment \nand cherishing the experiences thanks Jake I needed that \nreminder from now on I'll try to balance work and life \nbetter we go to the gym club together \nWe go to the gym club together \nhey Clara long time no see you look so fit what's your \nsecret hi Emily thank you I've been going to the new gin club downtown it's \nbeen a game changer for me really I've heard about that place \nI've been thinking of going but I don't want to go alone well how about this we go to the \ngym club together it'll be more fun and we can motivate each other \nthat sounds like a great idea Clara I've always found it hard to stick to a gym routine without a \nbuddy exactly and with the both of us we can try out different classes yoga spinning \nyou name it oh I've always wanted to try a Zumba class this is getting \nexciting Zumba it is then let's sign up this weekend and start our fitness \njourney together \nI don't think I liked the [Applause] \nI don't think I liked the movie \nmovie hey Sarah I finally saw the haunting Echoes last night oh that movie \nI watched it last week what did you think honestly I don't think I like the \nmovie The Plot was confusing and the characters were so flat \nreally I found it quite engaging and mysterious I was on the edge of my seat the entire \ntime maybe I was expecting too much everyone said it was the best \nhorror movie of the year it's true it got a lot of hype but \nmovies are subjective right everyone has their own taste you're right but the ending was \nreally predictable don't you think I'll give you that the ending could have been \nbetter but the cinematography was topnotch I agree with the cinematography \npart even if I didn't love it it was worth to watch let's pick another one for next \nweek I have my haircut every [Music] \nI have my hair cut every month \nmonth oh my God Lisa your hair looks fabulous \ntoday did you do something new thanks Amy actually I just got it \ntrimmed at that new salon downtown it suits you so well I've been \nthinking about changing my hairstyle too you totally should it's always \nrefreshing to try something new I have my haircut every month \nevery month isn't that a bit too often not for me my hair grows super fast and \nI like to keep it in shape I wish my hair grew that fast it \ntakes forever for it to grow even an inch maybe it's about the products you \nuse or your diet hair growth can be influenced by many \nfactors that's true I'll look into it and maybe just maybe I'll try that new \nsalon you mentioned do it Amy and let me know if you need any recommendations or \ntips I'm really out of \nI'm really out of practice \npractice Hey Jake I noticed you have a guitar in your living room do you \nplay oh that old thing when I was young I played the \nguitar haven't touched in years though that's so cool you should play \nsomething for me sometime I'm really out of practice it's been ages since I last \nplayed you know I've always wanted to learn the guitar maybe you could teach me I'd love to but I'm not sure I'd be \nthe best teacher doesn't matter I think it would be fun to learn from a friend plus it'd \nbe a good way for you to practice again all right maybe we can give it a shot \nbut don't blame me if you don't become the next big star deal let's start this weekend I'm \nexcited I have two dogs at [Music] \nI have two dogs at home \nhome I'm really thinking about getting a pet my apartment feels so lonely these \ndays oh having a pet can be such a joy I have two dogs at home they're my \nbest companions that's wonderful what breeds are they one is a Labrador and the other \nis a beagle they have such contrasting personalities I can only \nimagine dogs are so diverse in their behaviors and quirks absolutely the labrador Max is \nsuper playful and energetic while Bella the Beagle is more reserved than \ncalm I've heard beagles can be quite stubborn is that true oh yes Bella can be quite a handful \nat times but she's also incredibly loyal and affectionate I think I'm leaning more \ntowards getting a dog then thanks for sharing [Music] \nSarah I couldn't help her [Music] \nI couldn't help her \nhey Sam you look a bit down today what happened it's about Lucy she's going \nthrough a tough time and I couldn't help her I heard about her family issues it \nmust be really hard for her yes and it's affecting her mental \nhealth I offered my support but she's pushing everyone away sometimes people need their space \nto process things it's not your fault I wish I could have done more for \nher it feels like I'm watching her suffer without being able to intervene it's natural to feel that way \nespecially when you care about someone but remember you can't carry everyone's \nburdens I know I just hope she'll come around and accept help when she's ready you've \nalways been there for her son maybe right now she just needs to find her own way thanks Peter it's just hard seeing \nsomeone you care about struggling and not being able to do anything about it I \nunderstand Sam just know you've done your best and sometimes that's all you \ncan do I appreciate your words Peter I'll try to keep that in \n[Music] mind he can hardly speak \nHe can hardly speak \nRachel have you seen Jake after the accident yes I visited him in the \nhospital yesterday it was tough seeing him like that I can't even imagine how's \nhe holding up physically he's healing but emotionally it's been tough on him he \ncan hardly speak oh no that's heartbreaking \nwas he conscious when you visited barely he recognized me but couldn't communicate \nmuch do the doctors say if he'll recover fully they're optimistic about his \nphysical recovery but they're concerned about the trauma that's so hard I wish there was \nsomething we could do to help for now just being there for him is important he \nneeds to know he's not alone I'll make sure to visit him tomorrow we should gather some friends \nand show him our support that's a wonderful idea Amy it would mean a lot to \nhim his boss might get angry with his \ntone hey did you hear the way Jake spoke to Mr Thompson today yeah I was right there it was \npretty bold wasn't it bold is one way to put it i' say it was borderline \ndisrespectful I mean I get that he was frustrated but his tone was \noff his boss might get angry with his tone Mr Thompson doesn't take such things \nlightly yeah I've seen him reprimand people for Less do you think Jake might get into \ntrouble honestly knowing Mr Thompson Jake might get off with a warning but if \nit continues who know knows I just hope Jake realizes and maybe apologizes it's not worth risking \nhis job over agreed emotions can run high but \nit's essential to keep a level ahead especially at [Music] \nwork we'll have a long day \nWe'll have a long day tomorrow \ntomorrow Jessica have you checked the schedule for tomorrow's event yeah I've just had a look it's \npacked from morning till late evening I told you we shouldn't have accepted three bookings in one \nday I know I know but they were all important clients we couldn't \nrefuse we'll have a long day tomorrow I hope you're ready for it I've prepared \nas much as I can but I'm worried about the team's energy levels by the evening we'll have to ensure we take \nbreak and maybe rotate tasks keep things fresh that's a good \nidea also we should probably have an emergency plan in case anything goes \nwrong right always better to be prepared I'll draft a plan tonight and \nsend it to you let's hope for the [Music] \nbest this is bad \nThis is bad \nHey Jake what's up hey have you seen the latest review about our Cafe \nonline no what does it say someone complained about the coffee \nbeing too cold and the service being slow oh no do they mention any staff in \nparticular not really but they seems really upset this is bad we need to address \nthis right away I agree maybe we should reach out \nto the customer directly and apologize that's a good idea and maybe offer them a complimentary drink or \ndiscount on their next visit we should also talk to the staff about speeding up the service and \nensuring quality all the time yes continuous training is key \nlet's schedule a staff meeting for tomorrow \nI'm taking a break \nI'm taking a [Music] \nbreak have you finished that project yet the deadline's tomorrow I know Mark I'm just feeling \nreally overwhelmed right now you've been on it for weeks what's holding you up \nit's not as simple as it looks I've been having issues with the data we all have problems Sarah but we \ncan't keep making excuses I'm not making excuses you have \nno idea the pressure I'm under look I get it but we need to \ndeliver the team is counting on you I'm taking a break I need to clear my \nmind you've got to be kidding me no I'm serious maybe a break is what I need to \ncome back stronger fine take your break but remember we need need that project \ndone I know and I promise it'll be \nready my wrist [Music] \nMy wrist hurts \nhurts hey you've been typing non-stop for hours you should take a \nbreak I know but this report is due tomorrow you're going to hurt yourself \nif you keep going like this actually my wrist \nhurts see that's what I'm talking about you need to rest I just want to finish this section \nand then I'll take a break at least wear that wrist support it might help I left \nit at home I didn't think I'd need it you should always have it with you \nespecially with how much you type I know I know lesson \nlearned do you want some pain relief cream I have some in my bag thanks that would \n[Music] help it's not going to be a \nIt's not going to be a problem \nproblem honey can you help me with some boxes to the storage room later I have a \nmeeting in an hour but if it doesn't take too long sure don't worry there are just a few \nshouldn't take more than 10 minutes all right then let's do it \nquickly oh by the way one of the boxes is filled with glass items can you \nhandle it I'll be careful but are you sure it's a good idea to move it without \nbubble wrap or something protective it's not going to be a problem I've packed them tightly with \nnewspapers if you say so but if anything breaks it's on you deal and thanks for helping out no \nproblem just remind me next time to wear my gym clothes moving boxes is a \n[Music] workout none of the options are \nNone of the options are good \ngood hey have you decided which college you're going to oh don't remind me I've been \nstruggling with that decision what's the issue I thought you got accepted into \nmultiple places I did but none of the options are good either too expensive too far or not \nthe right fit that's tough but you've got to make a decision \nsoon right yeah the deadline's next week I just don't know what to \ndo have you talked to your parents about it I have have but they just tell me to \nchoose what feels right not exactly helpful maybe take a day to visit each \ncampus again might help you decide that's a good idea thanks Alex it's just a lot of \npressure you know I get it but no matter where you go you'll do great just trust \n[Music] yourself my grandmother gave me the \nMy grandmother gave me the necklace \nnecklace \nhey Sarah that's a beautiful necklace you're wearing oh thanks Emma it's actually \nquite special to me why is that did you get it from someone important my grandmother gave me the \nnecklace it's been in our family for Generations wow that's amazing it must \nhold so many memories it does every time I wear it I feel \nconnected to my ancestors have you ever considered getting an appraised it could be worth a \nlot I've thought about it but I'm afraid of losing it as something happening to it that's understandable family \nheirlooms are irreplaceable exactly but maybe one day \nI'll pass it on to my daughter just like my grandmother did for \nme that's right and don't you ever forget \nThat\u2019s right, and don't you ever forget it! \nit hey remember when we used to play by the old treehouse in the woods of course those were the best \ntimes you always tried to scare me with ghost stories hey one of those stories was \ntrue which one the one about the ghost that roam the woods looking for its lost shoe \nthat's right and don't you ever forget it my grandma told me that story oh come on Mark it was just a \nstory to keep us kids from wandering too far you might not believe it but some \nstories have a hint of Truth in them all right then let's go back to the woods and find that ghost's \nshoe maybe when it's daylight I'm not risking it at night see even you're \nscared of your own stories hey I just like to be cautious whatever you say but if we ever \nfind that shoe I owe you an ice cream deal and I'll make sure to remind \nyou I made [Music] \nI made bacon \nbacon morning something smells good what are you cooking morning honey I made bacon \nthought we could have a hearty breakfast today sounds amazing do we have any eggs \nto go with it yes in the fridge well made it whip up some scrambled \neggs that would be great I'll set the table by the way I also got some fresh \norange juice thought it'd be a nice touch wow you're going all out for \nbreakfast today huh well it's the weekend why not make \nit special you have a point this is a nice change from our usual cereal \nroutine exactly sometimes a little change is good plus bacon makes everything \n[Music] better he has the ability to carry out \nHe has the ability to carry out big plans \nbig plans did you hear about Jake's new \nproject in the company yeah I did he's aiming to expand \nthe business internationally right exactly it sounds ambitious but if \nanyone can do it it's Jake he has the ability to carry out big plans I've seen \nhim take on challenging projects before right and he's so dedicated \nalways the first one in last one out I've noticed that too but I hope he \ndoesn't doesn't burn himself out it's a lot of pressure I think he can handle it \nhe's always been good Under Pressure true I just hope the team supports him a plan that big needs \neveryone's cooperation I'm sure we'll all chip in it's exciting to think about the company \ngrowing like that yeah and to think Jake is leading the charge it's going to be a \ngame Cher for sure \nI need a new pool cue \nI need a new pool [Music] \nqueue I really love this pool hall so much space and such a cool \nVibe yeah it's definitely one of the best I've been to ready for
