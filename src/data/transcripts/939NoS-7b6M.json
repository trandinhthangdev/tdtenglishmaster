    "transcript": "[Music] \ndisagreement and agreement \njim taylor and mike want to go watching \na movie in the cinema \nthey are discussing what movie they \nshould watch \n[Music] \nhey guys \nlook there are so many \nwhat should we watch \ni want to watch horror movies \nlook they have the haunted mirror it's \nreally popular recently \ni don't think watching horror movies is \na good idea \nyeah me neither \nit's not that i'm scared or anything i \njust think it's annoying to watch horror \nmovies at the theater \npeople scream really loud i cannot focus \non the movie at all \nwhat about watching a comedy movie \nthere is a movie called the silly dog \nwhat is it about \nit is about a high school student and \nhis dog who suddenly can talk it seems \npretty funny \num a talking dog huh \nnot my type of humor what do you think \nmike \ni don't like comedy to be honest they \nare too fake sometimes \nwhat about action movies \nare there good ones available now \noh right i like action movies too \nthere is the racing life \nit's about gangster teams racing against \neach other there are many thrilly \ndriving and fighting scenes \nthat sounds nice \nlet's go watch this one \ni agree with you guys \nlet's watch the racing life then it \nsounds really interesting \nallen and jack are talking about their \nfavorite volleyball players they are \narguing which player is better \n[Music] \nhey did you watch the volleyball \nnational league match last night \nit was jackal against red lions \nno i couldn't i had to do my homework \nlast night \nhow was it \nit was amazing the match was really \nintense until the last minute \nand of course my most favorite team red \nlions won in the most glorious way \nthe last score was really great \nah man now i really want to watch the \nmatch \ni bet red lions will be the champion \nthis season they've performed \nexcellently since the beginning \nno i don't think so \ni think my favorite team golden cat will \nbe the champion \nthey won last season and the team that \nwon last season continues to play this \nyear there is no reason for them to lose \n[Music] \nno no no even though you were my best \nfriends and i always agree with what you \nthink \nthis i have to disagree with you \ndespite being a young team red lions is \nreally strong \nthey have some of the strongest young \nmembers on the team with their youth and \nstrength they can absolutely defeat \ngolden cat \n[Music] \nwell i agree that red lions are \nphysically strong but i think they lack \nin skills and experience \ngolden cat has much more experience and \nskills as they have played for a long \ntime \nthey can surpass red lions with a good \nstrategy \nwell red lion's coach is really good \nhe has led a top brazilian volleyball \nteam before \nhe can lead red lions to the \nchampionship for sure \ni doubt that \ngolden cat has better teamwork \nthe members are very close to each other \nand work together in perfect harmony \nyou know teamwork is the most important \nwhen it comes to volleyball right \nwell i guess you were right \ngolden cat is at bigger advantage down \nbut let's wait and see you can't predict \nanything when it comes to sports \nyeah i couldn't agree with you more \nsports is full of surprises that's why \nit's enjoyable to watch \nit is the weekend \njess and her big sister anna are \ndeciding what to do \njess wants to walk the dog to the park \nbut anna wants to go shopping \nthey discuss to make the final decision \n[Music] \nhey anna tomorrow is sunday and i am \nfree

don't think so \nit will be really sunny tomorrow i don't \nwant to suffer under the harsh sun \n[Music] \ncome on anna it will not be that bad \nbesides it has been a while since we go \nout and exercise let's go for a walk you \nwant to lose weight for the summer right \nyes i see your point \nbut please not tomorrow i'm very tired \nthis week i just had tests after tests \nand now i only

hours ago \nbesides we can walk him another time \nit's not like the park will disappear \nokay then what do you want to do then i \ndon't want to stay at home tomorrow \nlet me think \nwhat about
