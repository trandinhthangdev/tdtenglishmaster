    "transcript": "Coming now. \nHi Jane. How do you do? \nOh, wow. \nYou just changed the sofa. \nI remember it was grey last time. \nYes, my mom just bought it for me. \nIt's smaller a little bit, but it matches the color of the house. \nI bought some apples and flowers Jane. \nDropp them in the kitchen. \nWhere? I drop them next to the refrigerator, \nis it okay? \nYes. Anywhere you want. \nCome here Alex. Look! \nWhat Jane has here. \nCream tart? \nYes. I made it this morning. \nTry it. \nWow. Perfect. \nI asked Hazel to come with us. But she said that she has a stomach ache. \nDid Hazel talk to you? \nNah, I don't know. \nThat's weird. \nShe always asks you when she doesn't feel good. \nHey, do you guys want to hang out this weekend? \nGreat idea. \nWhere should we go? \nIt shouldn't be far because I need to come back to work on Monday morning. \nEverybody also needs to work, Jane. \nNo worries at all. \nDo you want to go to the beach? \nSeriously? \nSure. \nWe just need to take a taxi there and chill. \nI just miss the smell of the beach. \nDo you think that it's possible? \nMaybe. \nThen we can bring some food. \nFruits and beer. \nLike going to a picnic on the beach. \nThe weather is quite suitable\nto have a trip to the beach. \nWho will take responsibility to prepare food? \nNormally it's Hazel. \nI haven't told her about this weekend yet, \nbut I'm sure she will join. \nShe loves the beach more than anyone else. \nBut \nWhat's up, Jane? \nI don't want to join Hazel. \nWhat? \nJane \nWhat happened to the two of you? \nNothing. \nCome on. \nHazel and you always go together. \nWhat's the matter with you? \nI just don't want to see her again. \nWhat? \nShe broke our promise,\nbut she didn't recognize her mistake. \nCan you tell us more details? \nWe didn't get your point clearly. \nTwo weeks ago. \nShould I buy popcorns at the moment? \nWhere's Hazel? \nThe movie's in starting in 15 minutes. \nOh. Do you want to check in now? \nNo thank you. \nI am waiting for my friend. \nWhy doesn't she pick up the phone? \nDid something happen to her? \nHello, Hazel. Where are you now? \nWhat happened to you? \nDo you know I called you many times. \nHi, Jane. \nWhat's going on? \nMy phone is in silent mode. \nI'm in a bar. \nMy company has a party tonight. \nDo you think you forgot something? \nForgot? No Jane. Come on. \nWhat happened? You should tell me directly. \nWe're supposed to go to the cinema today. \nYou forgot we bought tickets 1 week ago huh? \nOh my. I forgot it. \nBut why didn't you remind me? \nIf you told me, I would let you know that I'm busy today. \nThis is the annual party of my company. \nI cannot be absent. \nOkay, so this is my fault\nthat I didn't remind you? \nYou don't get my point. \nI mean, you should remind me. \nI'm so busy in recent days you know. \nSo I'm a redundant person. \nCome on. \nJane, listen. \nI didn't say that. Never. \nBut you should remind me. \nOr at least send me a message. \nI just came here. Then I can't leave. \nIt's also too far. \nBut.... \nI get your point. \nI think I wasted your time. \nYou should enjoy yourself with your colleagues. \nJane, it's not a big problem. Next time... \nNever. \nThen I hung up my phone. \nI haven't talked with her since that day. \nOh, come on, you guys are so childish. \nAlex, you also think it's my fault? \nNot at all. \nBut you should calm down to solve\nwith each other. \nI can't agree more with Alex. \nI know, but you know, \nthe movie was starting\nand I was still standing alone. \nShe didn't even apologize to me. \nIt's not my fault, is it? \nI don't want to talk about it any more. \nDo you want to have some fruits? \nI'll bring you guys some apples. \nAlex, do you want to have some thoughts with me? \nI think yes, Lily. \nI have never thought they will fight each other. Haha. \nSo do I. \nWe should give them a chance\nto talk with each other. \nEverything will be solved. \nDo you mean this weekend? \nBut Jane is a hard-ass. \nWe should talk with Hazel first. \nI think when we come to her house this evening. \nJane is coming. Don't let her know. \nJane, we decided to go to the beach this weekend. \nAlex will prepare food. \nReally? Alex, you're a star. \nBeers? I will bring them. \nOkay. Deal? \nWe will meet at the bus station at 8. Okay? \nWhy don't we drive there? \nIt's not far. I have a driving license. \nI'll drive. \nGet in, Jane. \nDon't forget beers. \nNever. Here. \nPerfect. \nOh, it's not the way to highway one. \nHazel will join us. \nYes, we're driving to pick her up. \nHey, what's wrong with the two of you? \nIt's not fun. I told you... \nDon't be stubborn like this. \nYou should talk with Hazel\nto handle your problem. \nHazel also has something to talk about with you. \nI don't care. \nI never make up with her. \nParking there. Hazel is coming. \nShe just messaged me. \nGet off! Jane! \nCome on Jane. \nHi. \nDo you guys want to talk privately? \nLily and I will wait in the car. \nYou guys have ten minutes. \nOkay. Hi, Jane. \nAbout that day.... \nOkay. What do you want? \nI have nothing to talk about with you. \nIt's my fault because I forgot. \nOkay. \nI didn't try blaming you. \nI'm so sorry. \nOkay. \nI didn't know you were waiting at the cinema. \nI thought you were still waiting at home. \nDon't tell me like that. \nI'm trying to explain to you. \nOkay? As you want. \nIt's my fault. \nBut you were getting mad,\nso it hurt me so bad. \nI couldn't calm down as well. \nSo sorry. \nWe have been together for five years. \nYou know me, don't you? \nSo you also know that\nI don't like being stood up? \nYes. Sorry. \nAll is my bad. \nBut don't shout at my face\nlike that anymore. \nI don't want to lose you. \nOkay. \nDid you bring anything for us? \nSure. \nI prepared food as usual. \nOh, Alex told me he would do that. \nAlex can cook?. \nI'll never trust him again. \nSo be friends again. \nOkay. I forgive you this time. \nLet's go. We'll be late. \nOh, Lana. Your skin looks tan. \nThis is amazing. \nDid you sunbathe? \nI did, I had a three day trip to California last week. \nEverything was wonderful. \nFor real? \nGosh, I was thinking about going there with my family. \nI gotta tell you this, Ivy. \nThe beach in California is awesome. \nReally? \nI'll go there this summer. \nI\u2019m so excited! Did you swim there? \nOf course. \nThe water is clear with golden sand. \nJust like Paradise. \nOh my God! \nFantastic. \nAnd also, I walked barefoot on the beach. \nIt just felt so good. \nBear foot? \nIs this a kind of costume? \nHow can I find it? \nWhat do you mean by a costume? \nBarefoot is super comfy. \nSome say it's good for your feet. \nThis is the first time I've heard about this. \nSo, where can you get that special bear thing? \nFrom the store? \nStore? \nI'm confused. \nYou don't have to buy anything. \nYou said bear foot, the animal? \nOh, no. \nI mean, walking on your feet,\nnot wearing any shoes. \nWhere\u2019s mom, dad? \nShe went to the grandparents\u2019 house tonight. \nShe'll be there to help them with something. \nSo when she home? \nWhat are we going to have for dinner? \nShe'll be back home tomorrow morning. \nSo we're going to cook by ourselves. \nDo you know how to cook? \nThat's a very good question. \nWell, I think I'm good with cooking eggs. \nJesus. Well, I\u2019m gonna cook tonight. \nWhat do you want to eat, then? \nOh, great. \nI think we can make roast beef with peppers. \nWhat do you think? \nSounds nice, dad. \nLet me check if we have enough ingredients. \nUhm, I just stopped by the supermarket. \nI got some groceries. \nWhat did you buy? \nSome pork, lettuce, carrots and eggs. \nOh, some beef too. \nOkay, but we need bell peppers also. \nIs there anything left in the fridge? \nLet me take a look. \nThere's chilli, tomatoes, eggplant. \nOh, these tomatoes look weird. \nI think they have already gone bad. \nI think we should throw them away. \nOkay. Oh, here they are! \nYou see them, bell peppers? \nYeah. Oh, why are these chillies so cold? \nWell\u2026Because they're chilly, duh! \nWelcome! I\u2019m Dan. \nI\u2019m your guide today. \nGood morning Dan. \nNice to meet you. \nMe too. \nWell, with some, this is their first time going by a cable car. \nSo it\u2019s important for you to know what to do in a cable car. \nEspecially with young kids. \nOkay, now I\u2019m gonna show you how we use the cable car here. \nAre you ready? \nYes. Please go ahead. \nI'm all ears. \nFirst, let\u2019s begin with the buttons. \nYou can see there\u2019s a row of buttons next to your seats. \nWe see it. What is this red button for? \nOh, in case of emergency, you press the red button. \nIt is next to the pause button. \nExcuse me, I can\u2019t see any paws button here. \nMaybe you should check again? \nReally? \nIt's supposed to be on your right side. \nWhere\u2019s it? \nI mean, a button with a paw image is kinda cute. \nbut it should be more visible, right? \nI think it's quite visible, ma'am. \nIt's the yellow one with two vertical lines. \nDo you see it? \nOh, pause! Jesus, silly me. \nI thought you were talking about animal paws! \nI guess we're very lucky today. \nLook, the weather is so nice. \nEverything is amazing so far. Thank you. \nAfter the trip, you will have a break. \nA break is, I think, necessary when you\u2019re tired. \nOh, there's a small shop over there. \nTake your time for your break. \nUhm\u2026I don\u2019t think I need a brake though. \nWe\u2019re gonna buy it from the shop? \nIt\u2019s a coffee shop, isn\u2019t it? \nWhat would we do with a brake? \nWell, you can take a rest, eat or drink something, I guess. \nWe\u2019ll keep going after 15 or 20 minutes. \nWhat do you think? \nWhat do you mean? \nLike\u2026 eating a brake? \nThat's kind of weird, isn't it? \nEating? Oh, no. \nYou got me wrong. \nI mean, you will have time to rest. \nBreak time, not the brake of a vehicle. \nOh. Hello, Jake. \nYou've just come back from your holiday, right? \nHow was your trip to Indonesia? \nOh, it was awesome. \nThe rivers, the beach and the food were wonderful. \nI love it there. \nThere's a lot of rivers there, right? \nIs traveling by boat fun? \nIt is. \nSomething happened, but it was fine after all. \nWhat happened? \nWell, when traveling by a boat on the river, we found a leak on the bottom. \nWe freaked out and didn't know what to do. \nA leek? You got scared because of a leek? \nGosh, who wouldn't be? \nThere\u2019re three people on the boat. \nI didn't want the boat to sink. \nWho wants to drown? \nNo, I mean\u2026How can a leek make the boat sink? \nThis doesn't make any sense. \nThe boat can be sunk by a kind of vegetable? \nA kind of vegetable? You\u2019re talking about leeks? \nGosh, I mean the leak, which can let water come in. \nA small crack caused a hole in the boat! \n"
