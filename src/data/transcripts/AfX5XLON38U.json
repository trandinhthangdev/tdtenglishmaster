\nsuper dry sometimes and they get rough \nand \nFlaky I see well we offer many types of \nhand cream and lotions over \nhere do you prefer fragrance-free \nproducts or scented \nones oh I want the scented ones but not \ntoo heavy \nthough we have Fresh's milk hydrating \nhand cream which is light scented and \nworks well for dry \nhands or the Neutrogena hand creams with \nlight texture are also a best \nchoice these are the samples of the two \nkinds of hand cream I \nsuggested hey I think the Neutrogena one \nis better the texture is good \nright you're right but I don't think I \nlike the smell of \nlavender oh we also have cherry blossome \nhere well I'll take this one \nthen do you have anything for dark \ncircles and puffiness under the \neyes I've tried so many products before \nbut they don't \nwork oh we \ndo we have eye gel and eye cream \nproducts from cows which make a great \ncombo for Eye \nTreatment it's our best \nseller okay how can I use \nit well you use the eye cream once a \nweek and the eye gel every \nday oh I see it takes a lot of time \nright if you like something for instant \nchange take a look at our makeup \nsection here we have new arrivals and \nour bestsellers next to \nthose look Mia this blush seems to suit \nyour makeup \nstyle really but I'm more into the \nliquid based type it Blends much easier \nand lasts \nlonger but it always smudges the \nfoundation that's simp so \nfrustrating I like the natural look it \ncreates but not until it ruins my makeup \nlook well you can try the cream blush \nhere which can both give you a natural \nmakeup look and still keep the \nfoundation \nintact with your heart-shaped face you \nshould blend the blush towards your \nhairline oh thanks for your tips I'll \nconsider \nthem how about this eyebrow pencil is \nthis on sale \nwell you'll get this Macy eyebrow pencil \nfor free with a $100 purchase and \nabove and I think you have a diamond \nface shape so a curved brow with an \nangled Arc can suit you \nwell that's nice let me \nsee I think if we take all the stuff we \nalready \nchose everything adds up to around $150 \nwhat do you \nthink well we're going to get all the
