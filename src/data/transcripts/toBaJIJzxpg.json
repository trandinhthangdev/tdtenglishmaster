    "transcript": "[Music] \nlet's practice English together it's a \ngreat way to \n[Music] \nimprove I really want to get better at \nspeaking English do you have any tips \nhave you tried practicing with a friend \nor a language partner no I haven't I \nusually study alone practicing with \nsomeone else can really help we could \npractice together if you like that \nsounds like a good idea how often should \nwe meet maybe twice a week to start we \ncan talk about different topics and \ncorrect each other I think that would be \nvery helpful what topics should we start \nwith how about everyday situations like \nordering food asking for directions or \ntalking about \nHobbies great choices I always get \nnervous when ordering food in English \nlet's start with that then we can \nroleplay being at a restaurant I'm \nlooking forward to it let's practice \nEnglish together it's a great way to \nimprove what's your plan for \n[Music] \ntoday how's your morning \ngoing well it's going well thanks just \nfinished some work how how about you \npretty good I've been organizing my desk \nit needed a tidy up that's productive it \nalways feels nice to have a clean \nworkspace absolutely I can focus better \nnow and what's your plan for today I'm \nplanning to go for a bike ride this \nafternoon the weather's perfect for it \nthat sounds like fun I might go for a \nwalk later fresh air is always nice \ndefinitely a bit of exercise and nature \ndo \n[Music] \nwonders I'm running a bit late \n[Music] \nsorry Emily I'm running a bit late sorry \noh Jack are you on your way to the \ncafe yes I'm on my way now but there's a \nbit of traffic no wor \ndo you know how long you'll be I think \nit might take another 15 minutes or so \nthat's fine I'll grab us a table and \nwait for you here do you want me to \norder your usual \ncoffee thanks Emily a coffee would be \ngreat maybe get yourself something to \nsnack on too my treat it's okay Jack \nthese things happen surprise me I'll be \nthere as soon as I can hopefully this \ntraffic clears up a bit sure thing drive \nsafe and don't rush we've got plenty of \ntime to catch up see you soon Jack \nthanks Emily see you in a \n[Music] \nbit I'm not feeling very \n[Music] \nwell \n[Music] \noh hey Mike you look a bit tired today \nis everything okay hi Sarah yeah I \ndidn't sleep well last night I'm not not \nfeeling very well I'm sorry to hear that \ndo you think you caught a cold or \nsomething maybe I have a headache and \nI'm a bit \nachy have you taken any medicine or had \na chance to \nrest I took some aspirin in the morning \nI'm planning to rest when I get home \nmake sure you drink plenty of water and \nmaybe some tea that always helps me \nthanks for the advice Sarah I'll do that \nalso if you're up for it I can make you \nsome homemade chicken soup it might help \nthat sounds really nice Sarah thank you \nI might take you up on that offer no \nproblem at all just let me know and try \nto take a warm bath it might ease the \naches I will thanks for looking out for \nme Sarah I appreciate \n[Music] \nit what do you think about this \n[Music] \nI've been thinking about taking up a new \nhobby oh that sounds interesting any \nideas in mind I'm considering either \nphotography or painting I want something \ncreative both are great choices \nphotography can be really fun especially \nif you like being \noutdoors that's true I do enjoy nature \nand capturing moments sounds exciting \npainting can be very relaxing too it's a \ngood way to express yourself I agree it \nmight be a nice way to unwind after work \nhave you thought about joining a class \nor a club for either hobby I have \nactually there's a local photography \nclub and a painting class at the \ncommunity center that could be a good \nway to start and meet people with \nsimilar \ninterests yeah I think I'll give one of \nthem a try what do you think about this \n[Music] \nwhere would you like to go for \nlunch I'm getting hungry where would you \nlike to go for lunch Alex I was just \nabout to say the same thing I could \nreally use a break from work do you have \nany preferences today something quick or \na sit down meal I don't mind really \nmaybe maybe something not too heavy how \nabout that new salad place they have a \nvariety of \noptions that sounds good I've heard that \nchicken Caesar salad is great yes and \nthe veggie wraps are also supposed to be \ndelicious perfect it's settled \n[Music] \nthen I completely agree with you \n[Music] \nI've been reading about the importance \nof recycling and reducing waste it's \nquite eye \nopening absolutely it's amazing how much \ndifference small changes could make \nright I've started separating my \nrecyclables and composting it's not as \nhard as I thought it would be that's \ngreat to hear I've been using reusable \nbags and containers too it helps reduce \nplastic use that's a good idea I should \nstart doing that as well well it's all \nabout making more conscious \nchoices exactly every little bit helps \nand if more people made these changes it \ncould have a big impact I completely \nagree with you we all have a part to \nplay in taking care of our environment \nand it's not just about recycling we \nshould also try to reduce our overall \nconsumption yes like buying less but \nchoosing better quality items that last \nlonger \n[Music] \nthat's a good \n[Music] \npoint did you see that new action movie \nthat came out last \nweek yeah I did I thought the special \neffects were \nincredible they were but I felt the \nstory line was a bit weak it could have \nbeen better that's true the plot wasn't \nvery original \nbut the action scenes were very well \ndone definitely I think movies like that \nare more about the experience than the \nstory I guess you're right sometimes \nit's just about enjoying the visuals and \nthe excitement exactly not every movie \nneeds to be deeply meaningful some are \njust for fun that's a good point it's \nall about the entertainment value \n[Music] \ncan you pass me the salt \n[Music] \nplease this pasta looks delicious Jake I \ncan't wait to try it thanks Greece I \ntried a new recipe today I hope it's as \ngood as it looks it smells amazing did \nyou use any special \nherbs yes I used some basil and oregano \nI also added a bit of garlic \nI love garlic and pasta it always adds \nso much flavor me too let's see how it \ntastes this is really good Jake the \nherbs make a big \ndifference I'm glad you like it I think \nit just needs a bit more salt can you \npass me the salt please sure here you go \ndid you notice the hint of red wine in \nthe sauce I tried something new now that \nyou mention it there is a Rich depth to \nthe sauce it's a great \naddition I'm experimenting more with \nflavors lately cooking has become a real \nhobby for me you're really good at it \nyou could possibly start your own \nrestaurant maybe one day for now I'm \nhappy just cooking for \n[Music] \nfriends can you please turn down the \nmusic \n[Music] \nthis Cafe is quite Coy isn't it \nRyan yeah I like the atmosphere here \nit's a great spot to relax or do some \nwork the coffee is really good too I \nmight get a second cup I was thinking \nthe same but do you find the music a bit \nloud now that you mention it it is a bit \nlouder than usual it's making it hard \nfor me to concentrate on my reading \nwould you like me to ask them to turn it \ndown a bit would you mind that would be \ngreat not at \n[Music] \nall excuse me can you please turn down \nthe music no problem \nMiss thanks Mia it's nice to have a \nquieter environment no problem I think \neveryone appreciates a more peaceful \nsetting do you come here often for \nreading yes it's one of my favorite \nspots the Ambiance is perfect especially \non quieter days I can see why do they \nhave any events here like book clubs or \nlive music \nnights they do have poetry nights every \nFriday it's quite \n[Music] \npopular I don't understand what you mean \n[Music] \nso I was reading about renewable energy \nsources it's quite an interesting topic \noh that sounds intriguing what exactly \ndid you learn well for example solar \nenergy uses the sun's power to generate \nelectricity that's pretty \nstraightforward how about wind \nenergy wind energy works by converting \nwind into Power using large \nturbines turbines are those like big \nfans kind of but they work the opposite \nway instead of using electricity to make \nwind they use wind to make \nelectricity H I'm not sure I follow I \ndon't understand what you \n[Music] \nmean can you show me how to do this \n[Music] \nthis new software is really confusing \nI'm not sure how to get started with the \nchart \nfunction oh the chart feature I've \nworked with that a lot maybe I could \nhelp that would be \nfantastic can you show me how to do this \nI need to create a chart for a \npresentation of course let's start by \nopening the chart \ntool do you see this icon \nhere yes I see it what's next now select \nthe type of chart you want to create \nthere are several options like bar line \nand pie charts I think a bar chart would \nwork best for my data all right once \nyou've selected it you can input your \ndata here let me show you how to format \nit this is already making more sense \nthanks for walking me through \n[Music] \nit that was a Fant fantastic \n[Music] \nmovie wow I can't believe how good that \nmovie \nwas I know right the
