\nthe end of this hallway \nthat might be too many for me \ni might have to find someone to share \nthe apartment with \nthat wouldn't be a problem ma'am we do \nallow sharing \nalso if you decide to

\nit is a thousand dollars a month \nelectricity and internet not included \nnot included \nisn't that a bit expensive \nwould eight hundred dollars be \nsufficient \ni'm sorry that price is too low for an \napartment that size \nwe can give you other options if you \nwant \ni really like that apartment though \nwhat about 900 \nthat's all i can afford right now 900 is \nlower than what we want but \nwe will make an exception for you \nthank you so much \ni would be really sad if i couldn't rent \nthis place it is an absolute gem \nyes we have had multiple inquiries about \nit so far \nbut since you called first it is natural \nthat you get to decide first \ni feel so lucky \ncan you send me the contract later \nof course i will send it to you as soon \nas possible it was lovely doing
