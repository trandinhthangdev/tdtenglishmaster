    "transcript": "Intro \nforeign \n[Music] \nIntroduce \ntoday we're going to try three effective \nmethods to practice speaking English \nthe first one is listen and repeat \nbasically you're given a dialogue in \nwhich you have to listen first then \nrepeat exactly what is said after that \nnext we have shadowing \nyou don't wait until it's over \ninstead you speak at the same time with \nit trying to copy the Rhythm and the \ntone of the dialogue exactly \nat first it can be a bit tricky but \nyou're gonna get used to this method \njust like singing along to your favorite \nsong \nthen we have duet now you're part of the \nconversation \nthere's going to be a line for you to \nsay \nready let's jump into it \nExercise 1: Listen and repeat \nexercise one listen and repeat \nfor the

high \nfor me \nso a library card can sometimes come in \nhandy \nI got it \nwell we offer three types of cards here \nwe have white blue and red cards \num can you explain a bit more about \nthose types \nthe white is only for printed sources \nthe blue is for online sources \nand unlimited access to all the sources \nfor the red card \noh okay \nI guess I'm gonna go with the white card \nthen \nonline books are really not for me how \nmuch is the white card though \nthirty dollars for each the card is \nvalid for two months \num that sounds reasonable \nby the way we have a 15 discount for \ncollege students \nforeign \nuntil next Monday May the 5th \nwow even better how can I sign up for a \nwhite card \nhere is the form you need to fill in \n[Music] \nand this form needs to be stamped
