    "transcript": "At School \nOh. Hello, Mitchell. \nHi, Abraham. \nIs everything okay? \nYou look tired. \nVery tired, Mitchell. \nI just became the homeroom teacher of the class 5E. \nGod, this is terrible. \nDid something happen? \nThe young students refused to sit still. \nThey talk to and tease each other. \nI've taken all measures, from yelling to talking. \nI even thought about beating them up. \nOh, I understand. \nTeaching young children is indeed a difficult thing. \nEspecially for young teachers like you. \nI feel like I don't have enough patience. \nPatience is essential when teaching younger children. \nIs it because of the content of the lesson? \nI'm not sure. \nThe teachers observing the lesson\nall rated me well. \nBesides, the students also understand. \nHow do you know? \nI give them regular tests. \nThe students all do well, although not exclusively. \nSo it's clearly not because of your knowledge. \nTo me, you don't have enough experience to comfort children. \nOh, what a headache. \nWhat about you, Mitchell? \nYou are a homeroom\nteacher of a more mature class. \nThat's wonderful. \nWell, I don't think so. \nThose 11th-grade students. \nI can not understand their language. \nOh, I heard how the tertiary students talk. \nIt's not that difficult to understand. \nIf you use the internet enough. \nThat's the problem. \nI am not young enough to use the internet\nas much as you guys anymore. \nFurthermore, the students think we don't understand anything about them \nand refuse to share with me. \nDo you have any criticism about the students' lifestyle? \nsuch as clothes, hobbies, opinions, etc. \nNever. Abraham. \nYou know that respecting everyone is my principle. \nI think maybe they see me\nas an old fashioned man. \nAlas, I have been teaching for 30 years. \nI can no longer keep up with the youth. \nWell, it's difficult. \nHmm, how can we tackle this problem? \nBingo. \nWhat's that, Abraham? \nSimple! \nWhile you have a lot of experience and patience with children, \nI am closer and communicate better with teenagers. \nWhat do you think? \nYou mean...? \nWe will exchange our classes. \nRight! \nBy that, teenagers will be more interested in the lessons. \nCorrect! And I can be considerate of the children. \nSo we will discuss it with the principal\nto rearrange the classes. \nIt will be better tested in a month. \nBut hey, Abraham, what about the lessons? \nI have prepared lectures\nspecifically for 11th grade student. \nOh, I have a new method. \nLook at this. \nLectures will be constructed based on this\nmodule, with outlines and headings. \nAnd that helps you edit the content yourself. \nYou can teach any class. \nGreat. \nLet's go meet the principal. \n"
