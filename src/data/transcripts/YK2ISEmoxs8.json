    "transcript": "Good morning class. \nToday we're going to explore the simple present tense. \nIt might sound a bit tricky, but trust me, \nit's simpler than you think. \nMiss Jessica, what exactly is simple present tense? \nGreat question, Somi! \nThe Simple Present Tense is used to talk about \nhabits, routines, and general truths. \nFor example, I eat lunch every day. \nThe action happens regularly. \nSo it's like things we do all the time. \nExactly, Flavio! Now, let's try a sentence together. \nMaxim, can you give me an example? \nI go to the park on Saturdays. \nFantastic, Maxim. \nThat's a perfect example. \nNow let's explore some more. \nNam, can you share a sentence? \nNam? \nSorry, Jessica, I don't get it. \nIt's okay, Nam. Learning takes time. \nLet's hear an example from Gyaan. \nI play game in the evening. \nWonderful, Gyaan! You've got the hang of it. \nBut what if the subject is, like, we, they,... plural? \nGreat question. Somi. \nIf the subject is plural, we don't add \"s\" or \"es\" to the verb. \nFor example, they eat pizza on Fridays. \nSo, is there only one subject that adds an 's' or 'es'? \nExactly. \nYou're catching on fast. \nNow let's try some questions together. \nFlavio, ask Somi a question using the Simple Present Tense. \nSomi, what do you like? \nIt's not your business. \nFine. \nSomi, we're learning, \nyou should answer back using the Simple Present Tense. \nYes, Ms. Jessica. \nI don't like you. \nYou don't understand English? \nI ask what you like, not what you don't like. \nYes. \nI don't understand English, so I'm here to learn. \nAre you all right? \nYes, teacher. I'm fine. \nNow, everyone, take a look at these sentences. \nFind the mistakes and correct them. \nOh, God. \nI'm coming right now. \nMiss Jessica, you're still here. \nNam. Is everything alright? \nNam, I've noticed you've been nodding off in class quite a bit and falling asleep. \nIs everything really okay? \nOh, sorry, Jessica. I didn't mean to. \nI guess I'm... a bit tired lately. \nI'm concerned it might be affecting your studies. \nIs there anything going on\noutside of class that's bothering you? \nNo, no. Everything's okay. \nI'm sorry for making you worry. \nI just need to get more sleep. \nIt's not just about sleep, Nam. \nI want to make sure you're not facing\nany challenges that could impact you. \nI know, but that's true, teacher, everything is... fine. \nThank you... your concern. \nBut I promise I'll try hard to... \nno sleep in class and focused... in class. \nI'm glad to hear that, Nam. \nIf there's anything you need,... \nor if you're facing challenges, don't hesitate to let me know. \nI'm here to support you. \nThank you. Jessica. \nYou are so kind. \nI'll make sure... \ntonight, I will review the lesson today. \nI don't let myself fall behind. \nSorry, I have to go. \nSee you tomorrow. \nI haven't eaten anything yet,\nso I'll have dinner here. \nLet's see what makes this\nItalian restaurant so crowded. \nAnd if their food is really that good. \nGood evening! \nI'm Lily, the manager. Nice to meet you. \nHello. \nHow do you feel about our food? \nBad food. \nInteresting. \nOh, I mean, I'm sorry to hear that. \nWe always prioritize customer satisfaction. \nHow about I compensate you with a date? \nA date? \nYes? \nShe said so fast. \nI can't understand. \nYou and me. \nYes? \nShe must love my face. \nYou're worried that I do that\nto all the other customers here? \nIt's just you. \nIt's that useless guy again. \nHe was causing trouble every day. \nWho are they? \nThe men in luxurious clothes is my father. \nThe restaurant owner? \nThe useless boy is Nam, an exchange student and a waiter here. \nHe's slow and often makes my father angry. \nHe's so annoying. \nYou're annoying too. \nYou chased my customer away. Nam. \nShe hasn't paid yet. \nNo. She made that on purpose. \nI don't care. \nI only care who will pay for this meal. \nShe claimed the food was expensive and not delicious. \nThen she said she didn't want to pay. \nShe broke the glass... by herself. \nThis meal and the broken glass. \nDo you know how much it costs? \nYour two months' wage is not enough. \nBut I didn't do anything wrong. \nShut up! No matter who's wrong, she's gone. \nYou will pay for this meal. \nI don't have enough money to pay you. \nSo it looks like your wage this month is zero. \nAnd next month you also have to work for me for free. \nNo, I didn't do anything wrong. \nI also need money to pay tuition. \nTalks a lot. Hurry up and get to work. \nOther customers are waiting. \nNo... I... \nDidn't you hear what he said? \nFlavio? \nYour customer created trouble\nand didn't want to pay. \nYou didn't handle her, stop her. \nBut here, bullying a student? \nIt's not your business. \nOh, I hate this sentence. \nCheck the camera and you'll know right away. \nNo need to check. I'm the boss here. \nIf I say he's wrong, he's wrong. \nI understand. \nUnderstand what? \nWhy is your food so bad? \nIt's bad like you. \nBullshit. \nGet back to work now. \nIf you don't, then quit your job. \nFlavio\u2026 ignore him\u2026 \nVery well then. He quit his job. \nHere. \nOne for you. \nThank you. \nIs your ex-boss always so hateful? \nYeah. He often bullies me. \nMakes me work overtime without extra pay, \ngives me leftovers for dinner. \nThat's probably why you're always... sleep... in class. \nWell yeah... \nWhy don't you quit? \nI'm an exchange student. \nMy family isn't rich. \nIt's very difficult to find a job here. \nEven a part time job. \nBecause my English is not good. \nSo when he yelled at me. \nI just nod and... ignore him. \nI just need the wage to support myself. \nYour English is better than mine. \nThanks. \nI'm sorry for making you quit... your job. \nNo, Flavio. \nI must thank you. \nIt's okay. I'll find another job. \nActually, my restaurant is looking for a waiter. \nYou can work there. \nReally? I'd love to. \nYeah, you can start tomorrow. \nHere, call me when you come. \nThank you, Flavio. \nThank you so much. I'll work hard. \nI promise to pay back\nthe money you paid for that meal. \nNo need. \nWhy? \nBecause I ate at that restaurant but didn't pay yet. \nThank you so much. \nCan I hug you? \nNo, please. \nOkay. \nHe hasn't paid for his meal yet!!! \n"
