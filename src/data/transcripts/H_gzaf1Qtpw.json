free time \nhello today is such a nice day isn't it yes it's good to see the sun after \nnearly an entire week of rain can i know your name please \nmy name is albert what about you i'm evelyn nice to meet you \ni'm doing a survey for my homework do you mind if i ask you some questions \nof course no problem thank you so much \nfirst how old are you i'm currently 64. \nturning 65 in a few weeks all right you're retired aren't you \nyes i am what do you usually do in your free time \nbefore i retired i was a chef i love cooking so i usually help my wife \nprepare meals for the day that's the activity that takes up most of my time \ndo you have any other daily activities well once in a while i check around the \nhouse to see if there's anything that needs to be fixed maybe a broken light bulb things like \nthat i jog around the park every morning \nand in the afternoon i take my dog phillip out for a walk so what about the \nweekends we have a family reunion every saturday \nwhere my children and grandchildren spend the entire day at my house \nwe cook together keep an eye out for the children and spend hours talking until it's late \nand the children are all sleepy that sounds really warm you such a \ndesirable family do you have any particular hobbies \nit might sound weird for my age but i really like traveling whether it's just a road trip \nto the suburbs a hike or a long vacation to further destinations \ni enjoy all of them so much it's not weird at all i think it's very \ninspiring who do you often go on these trips with with my wife and my family of course \nbut sometimes i go with my friend josh he's our neighbor and he also loves traveling as much as i do \nso why do you like traveling so much i spent my entire youth working to give \nmy family a comfortable life i didn't retire because i couldn't work \nanymore but because i want to learn to live to the fullest \ni choose traveling since it gives me beautiful memory and knowledge along the way \ni see i might be old but i'm still strong enough to go here \nand there i don't want to lie on a bed years later and blame myself for living a boring \nlife traveling tightens the bond between me and my children \nwhen we all had fun together those are the moments that i will never forget \nthat's amazing all right that's everything i need to ask thank you for your time you're welcome \ngood luck with the homework [Music] \nLucy \nevelyn hi oh hello lucy you're here too yes this park is my \nfavorite place to come on the weekends what are you doing here oh i'm just \ninterviewing

hobbies well of course dancing keeps me stay in \nshape i'm not that tall already so i need a \nnice body i just mentioned the other reason why i dance \nand i draw regularly to practice my skills of course to stay creative too great \nwhat about shopping there's actually no particular reason \nfor that i just love going out and looking at things \nit works as a way to help me learn to look at life from a more optimistic perspective \nyou know the shops are always so colorful and sometimes i get inspiration for my \ndrawings after going shopping too i can see most of your hobbies have \nsomething to do with art do you wish to have a career in this field \nyes i want to be a fashion designer now when i think about it i guess that's \nalso one of the reasons why i like to draw do your parents support you it took some \nconvincing at first my parents used to seem quite upset when \ni spent too much time drawing but after we had a serious conversation \nabout my future and what i want to pursue they understood and \nlater started to support me that's amazing i'm so happy for you \nalright that's all the questions i need to ask i have to go now thank you so much and \nsee you

clean the fridge dishwasher oven and bathtubs sinks toilets inside and \nout good make sure that your fridge is emptied and that you've cleaned out \nevery shelf and drawer you already know that these

look \nlarger so use a good glass cleaner and make sure to leave any glass surfaces as clear as possible \nhow about marks that have accumulated over the years on walls and counters a good \nscrubbing should get rid of most of it more pressing is any damage to the walls \nor counters which might need to be fixed with either new paint or even putty \nokay what should i do with the floor your floors are the easiest area to see \nin your home take the time to clean any carpets and use cleaners that you might have on your \nhardwork stores and the little things like light fixtures switch plates

with her new friend emma about the culture in england \nand america \nhi anne welcome to boston high school i'm emma i'm your new classmate let me \nshow you around thanks emma nice to meet you so anne \nwhere do you come from i'm from london this is the first time i've traveled to \namerica wow all the way from england i've always \nwanted to travel there living in a new country is fun and exciting but it's going to be a big \nchange for me so i want to know more about this country \nyou share some common things about the american culture please sure the american culture is very \ninteresting first of all americans often prefer large and luxurious \nto them large can be practical i think thinking big also applies to \namerican food too most restaurants serve very large portions \namericans love going out to eat or ordering takeout so if you're going to out to eat and \naren't sure of the size it's okay to ask your server what they recommend \nyes because the u.s is a melting pot of different cultures bringing along a variety of tasty foods \nthat's right even in small american towns you're likely to find pizza chinese \njapanese or mexican food in larger cities you'll find restaurants devoted to ethiopian brazilian or \nafghani cuisine that's cool and i can see that many \namericans love and follow sports people say one of the most popular differences between \nbritish and american english is how they see the games really \namericans do not like small scores that's why they do not like football \nthey tend to like games with big scores like basketball and american people and the english people \ntend to be more patient in playing and this can be seen in many games such as qriket and football \noh sports can be a huge uniting and dividing factor among americans \nduring football and basketball season you might see people getting into spirited debates about whose team is \nbetter football is fun to watch but can be pretty confusing to follow \ncan you help me out i want to know why over a hundred million americans watch the 2017 super bowl \nsure no problem what else do you want to know \nwhat is the main religion in america back in my hometown people are now \ngetting away from the church and tend to be less religious the united states is remains a \npredominantly christian nation people in the united states tend to be more religious \nespecially those living in the southern regions oh how about the people in america \noften americans tend to be friendly they tend to want to be part of someone else's problems as they communicate \nthe english people really appreciate personal privacy and they try to give respect without too \nentering the private affairs of others this difference is the reason why the english tend to be \ncooler i guess so and you know that the british \ntend to be elegant in appearance right this is the opposite of most americans who tend to be casual \njeans were created first in the united states and we now know why they were not created in england \ntrue the english people tend to be more polite even the level of decency the british \npeople have is often viewed as higher than the average of other europeans \nthis tends to contradict the american way of communicating they tend to bring out jokes which for \nmost english people are quite rough americans also tend to speak \nmany consider the united states and the united kingdom are two nations divided by the same \nlanguage however while it is true that both nations have historically shared a close relationship \nthey have major differences in culture i agree but it's a fact that both of \nthese cultures are interesting i want to travel to england to learn all about its culture \nyou can come with me when i go back to england to this summer really that's great thanks \nno problem [Music] \nConversation 2 Linda and David \nsituation two linda and david travel to london and their tour guide \nluke introduces them to

other they're known for their \nloutish drunken behavior while abroad really how well both types of brits are \nfairly common but two activities that tend to unite all uk citizens queuing and talking about the weather \nwith all this diversity comes all different types of cultures right yes walking down my street \nthere is an english pub a burger place multiple italian indian thai and chinese restaurants most \nanything to satisfy your taste buds besides the famous english breakfast \nfish and chips what are the other popular foods in britain \nthe uk's most popular dish is actually chicken tikka masala \nand the quaint cream tea which derives from devon it's a light meal designed to be eaten \nin the afternoon combining tea with dainty sandwiches and cakes \nthat sounds so delicious i can't wait to try it out how about uk art the united kingdom has \na rich history in the arts london's west end has a reputation akin to new york's broadway \nwhat genres of music are popular to the british the west end is home to several theaters \nshowing popular plays and musicals really i want to go to a music festival \nbefore i go back to the us many genres of music have a huge \nfollowing in the uk from the country's super clubs putting on famous djs to wembley stadium and the o2 hosting \ninternational stock oh there are the uk's renowned music \nfestivals the likes

what happened did you get up early this \nmorning not really last night my friends asked \nme to go out and have beers i was actually quite happy this morning \ni had no hangover what about you well i actually woke up \nthis morning quite early i couldn't sleep so i was a little annoyed \nwhat time did you get up i guess around eight o'clock \nthat's not early i was thinking it would be around five or six am that is \nreally early for me i went to bed at three o'clock i thought you were an early bird \nyou are wrong i am a night owl for sure so i usually don't go to bed until about \n3 am i find it difficult to go to sleep early \ndon't you have to go to work i am on my summer holiday now \nif i have class from the first period every day so i will have to get up about 7 30 or 8 \nam so i will probably sleep earlier \nit is really challenging for me you know i try to go to bed early 10 o'clock \n11 30 before midnight and i try to get up early 6 30 \n7 before 8 but it doesn't always work what about you \nwhat time do you often go to bed well i usually wake up maybe six or \nseven in the morning but i don't get up straight away i stay in bed for a while maybe read a \nbook or something check my phone messages and i get up at maybe 7 \n30 8 o'clock on the weekend i often get up at six \no'clock to go to the park with my father we go jogging together \nyou are having a very healthy life what about during the holiday \n[Music] if it's a day off i get up at 9 or 10 and in the evening i usually go to bed \naround 10 11 sometimes 12. do you need an alarm clock to wake you \nup or you just wake up naturally every day i actually have this kind of \nspecial mental ability i feel it a bit weird i thought that \neverybody can do this but i found out it's not the case but i can wake up exactly the minute i \nwant anytime that's amazing \neven though i wake up kinda easily i can't wake up at a routine time \nso i usually set the alarm on my phone and about two alarm clocks as well that will \nusually get me up so like if i have to get up at 6 14 \nbefore i go to bed i can say okay get up at 6 14 and i'll wake up at exactly 6 14. \nhow do you do that tell me please yeah i don't know how i guess your brain \ncan just keep time when i tell people this sometimes they \nthink oh come on that's not true but really ever since i was a kid i \ncould just tell myself what time i want to wake up and i'll wake up exactly at that time \nthat's really quite amazing i wish it was that way for me but it's not yeah \nyou know what's weird because i don't use alarm clocks \nwhat do you mean i can't like an alarm clock the idea actually i \ncan't have a deep sleep if i know that it's going to ring and wake me up \nan alarm clock is like somebody pouring cold water on me you know \nyeah i'm always paranoid about being late so that's why i set three just in case one doesn't go off \nbut i can sleep any time of the day wow that's like you do you like sleep \nlike it really doesn't matter what occasion or type of day it's very easy for me to fall asleep \nfor as long as whenever so that's why i need to have many things \nto wake me up because i could sleep 12 or 14 hours and not wake up \nso do you take naps usually an hour \ni find out if i go over an hour then that's the danger zone because then if you sleep like two or \nthree hours you wake up and you're just groggy for the whole day \nand if i sleep a lot during noon when i wake up i usually have headaches \nso now i am trying not to take naps like can you sleep with the light on \nyes i can sleep in any situation light noise standing sitting up \nnever matters to me i can still sleep so you're definitely a deep sleeper i'm \nso jealous of that like just a tiny bit of noise or a little bit of light and i can't sleep \nand actually i probably only get an average of five hours a night but i do sometimes take naps \nyeah not for two i mean i can't sleep forever but like seven o'clock eight o'clock \nthen my body naturally wakes up the flat i lived at before was \nincredibly crazy because there was a rooster outside and it didn't \ndo what it was supposed to do like normal when the sun comes up the rooster is supposed to go or \nwhatever this thing did it at like one and two in the morning it used to drive me nuts so i used to \nalways wake up at two because i'd hear this rooster and i just wanted to kill that bird \ndid you go back to sleep after that yeah of course i went back to sleep but \nthe bird would wake me up regularly yeah no roosters here \nConversation 4 Likes and Favorites

now a chemist \ndo i look like a chemist when i have a hip hop style like this \ni guess not but perhaps now chemists changed their uniforms after one year of \ngraduation from university i dropped my job and became a photographer \nreally that's such a significant change harry [Music] many people disagreed with me but i \nthink it is the right choice ah are you going to the football match \nthis

his mother sounds not so worried about \nhis condition so i assume he is fine if it's really just a common cold he \nwill be fine in a few days should we call him to check up on him \ni guess he could use some encouragement but it's only seven in the morning \ni think he is still asleep let him have his rest people \ndesperately need sleep to recover we can text him though he can read it \nwhenever

first \ntime her 15 year old daughter has had a holiday in vietnam so if she is really \nexcited to want to know the preparations and to-do list for the lunar new year \nmom we can't go back to england this month can we that's right my daughter \njust a few flights to england due to covet 19. this time is close to the lunar new year \nin vietnam this year we will experience the tet atmosphere in vietnam awesome \nit's my first time but i also miss my paternal grandparents so much i know \nbut we have to protect ourselves first this also means you are protecting \npeople right you can make a video call with them and tell them the reason why you're staying \nin vietnam your grandparents will understand \nyes i'll do it that's good alice are you excited about lunar new \nyear a hundred percent this is the first time i've been in vietnam on the tet holiday \neven i don't know more about this important event so do you want me to talk about \nsomething outstanding before and during the tet holiday in vietnam \nabsolutely first i want to know what we need to prepare for this event \nokay i'll tell you about kitchen guardians first have that day \nis that day which we lead worship some people protecting our kitchen during the year \nbasically it's like that according to the lunar calendar the day is the 23rd of december \nin every vietnamese household besides the ancestral altar and fatherland altar there is also the \nexistence of another one called the god of kitchen altar \nin vietnamese's opinion the god of kitchen is one who knows every nook and cranny \nof a place knows every nook and cranny really \nbut i haven't seen them before oh my alice you're 15 years old why do you think \nthey exist in reality it's just spiritual daughter we cannot \nsee we just believe in it in other words they are like ancestors \ni thought i could see them and ask them for help when i'm punished by you \ni really need to learn much more about the vietnamese rituals i'm considering myself a silly person \nwhat a shame unfortunately they don't exist so you'll be punished without any help \nif your naughty little daughter mom i just remembered someone told me \nthat alter joss papering burning we will release golden carp into lakes which symbolizes \nthat kitchen guardians ride carp to heaven to deliver an annual report on the household's \nactivities to the i don't remember who receives the report \nfrom them jade emperor yeah \nit's him jade emperor do you know what we do after the kitchen \nguardian day i i don't why do you ask me such a \ndifficult question like that this is the first time i've celebrated tet in vietnam \nthat's why i want you to guess if right you'll be rewarded mom \nyou don't tell a lie certainly i'll give you a close rule that's so \neasy related to worship \nwith the clue the question is a piece of cake cleaning the altar is my answer \ncorrect so what do we do next mom you told me you just asked \none question and if i answer correctly i'll be rewarded that's not fair alice i'll still reward \nyou i don't challenge you with the second question oh let me think we go shopping to buy \nsome adornment right yes that's true but we adorn after few \ndays not suddenly often around three or four days \nso exciting i love this part most i'm addicted to decorating \nif so i assign you this mission okay believe in me i'll decorate our house \nlike a palace it's up to you \nlots of things to do and i'm so looking forward to celebrating tet \nthese are all your favorite parts and now i'll tell you the part of work you hate don't tell me this is cleanup mom \nit's my nightmare you are right we have to clean up before \ntet oh no why mom \ni just clean up a little bit each day as long as you have to finish this work \nbefore tet please give me a reason mom \naccording to vietnamese opinion we shouldn't sweep the house or empty \nout rubbish on the first day of the year to avoid luck and benefits going with it so that's why you must \nclean up before tet moreover you'll feel relaxed when entering a spotless and beautiful house \nduring tet right rational i'll try my best to welcome my first tet \nin vietnam [Music] happy to hear that well you can go to \nthe flower market people often choose gladulus lily or tulip besides peach blossoms and \napricot flower will you go with me to the flower market \ni don't know how to choose fresh flowers i will one more important thing we must \ndo is cooking new year eve meal i know that i'll cook with you i love the feeling of \ncatering for our beloved family members and during the tet holiday we are gonna \ncook new year's meal and then we visit relatives and friends to exchange new year wishes \nyou'll receive lucky money from them wow probably i'll have lots of money for \nthis special event in addition a lot of people gather at the temple of literature \nto watch calligraphy masters writing calligraphy scrolls \ni've seen it before when will we go there mom \n[Music] \nsituation 2 mother and daughter are talking about daughter's boyfriend \non the third or fourth day of january in the lunar calendar well you can ask your boyfriend out \nto go to the temple of literature with our family and then we'll have \ndinner together mom why do you say that i don't have a \nboyfriend what did you say you don't have a boyfriend \nno i don't really are you sure mom \nwhy would you do that to your little daughter i've had a boyfriend \ni didn't say wrong but how did you know i tried to hide it i saw you smiling \nwhen you were chatting with someone i guess it's your lover because you always laugh out loud when texting with \nfriends but at that time you just smiled how observant you are and you don't need \nto hide that from me you can confide in me i'm really open-minded about that \nnow tell me how he is i want to know that my little daughter is happy in love \nhe's so handsome and gets a tan this makes him look more manly and strong \nprobably he is really hard working in going to the fitness center vice versa you're a couch potato \nmom i'm much harder than ever before okay i recognize it how about his \npersonality i was impressed by his cold face first \ni did think that he was unpleasant and willful person even i find him a little stubborn as a \nmule but now by myself i realized that i was \nwrong you don't have an eye for anything my alice \ni know that so mom don't rub salt in my wound like that well surely your boyfriend is careful as \nfor you careless he is very careful \nhe often reminds me how to do this how to do that in addition he's also talkative this is \ntotally different from my first impression i'm happy to hear that so what else \noh a lot i can't tell everything about him in one day mom \nmy boyfriend is clever and cautious he does almost everything in a careful \nway what about a sense of humor because my daughter likes someone who has this \ncharacter certainly exciting outgoing \nfunny he has it all he's really serious to explain to me when we have in \ntrouble or i do something wrong as well according to what you've said i think he \ncan be a reliable person it's good for both of you is he \nambitious absolutely but not too much [Music] \nhe wants to be independent in every aspect so he wants to move up the career \nladder as soon as possible i like his point \ni can take some comfort when hearing that but alice you must remember one thing \nfor me it is said that love makes blind so don't be too blind yes \ni'll remember it i love you mom i love you too oh my god \nnow it's 3 p.m i'm late i have to go to the office now see you tonight bye mom drive carefully \nokay bye daughter \na health problem abdul and sally are talking about their \nillness experience and their ways to keep themselves healthy \nso what is the most serious illness you have ever experienced in your life i would like to \ntalk about a car accident that happened to me a few years ago and resulted in serious injury injuries \noh really how was it it was a horrible experience that i \nwould not want to relive oh dear tell me what happened please \nmy family was driving home when a big truck crashed into our passenger side \nafter the accident i blacked out and was transported to the hospital \nwhen i regained consciousness i discovered that i had five broken bones several ruptures \nand many cuts and bruises did you have any treatments after that \nto restore the collarbone and leg bone i had to go through operations during which metal rods were put onto \nthese bones to fix them not surprisingly i was in severe pain \nso physicians prescribed me to take painkillers and other medicines for a couple of \nweeks how long did it take you to recover \nduring my recovery i wasn't able to walk properly and my life then was very difficult \nbut after several months of proper treatment and physical therapy i fully recovered does your life change \na lot after i even took up karate soon after \nalthough the illness was definitely not a pleasant experience i'm very happy and grateful that now i \nam healthy probably i learned to value health and become stronger \nwow luckily you are healthy now yes i think so as well what about you \ndid you experience a lot of illness well i guess i will tell you about one \nmemorable experience it happened a few months ago when i had of the flu coupled with a sore throat \nwhat happened a week before it happened i was so \nstressed with work i had stayed up late in the night in the office to meet several deadlines \na lack of sleep and i couldn't also eat on time oh you must have been really tired \nmy body started to feel weak i started to have slight fever and colds i knew it was \ngoing to be bad because i was having headaches and severe muscle and body aches i also \nstarted to have a dry cough and my throat hurt did you go see the doctor \nit lasted for about a week i went to see a doctor so i could get the right prescription i was advised to have \nbed rest for a few days i was not able to report to work for a \nweek luckily i have already finished all of my deadlines before it happened \nbut it had still affected my life because i had failed to do my daily routine i also asked my mom to take care of me \nsince i lived alone when i went back to work there was a \nhuge pile of paperwork waiting on my desk \nhow was the health care system in your country costa rica is actually a pretty healthy \ncountry we have one of the only five blue zones in the world \nwhich are these areas where because of their lifestyle population frequently reaches a hundred \nyears or more is that one good signal about your \ncountry unsurprisingly one of the major health problems that we face is obesity \nbecause our modern lives are so frequently making us sedentary and working in office spaces and imposed \nrooms especially under the current conditions we tend to become overweight \nthat's true keeping a healthy lifestyle is not a priority for a lot of people \nespecially because they have very busy routines you know that being said it is important \nto keep a healthy lifestyle and it's one of those problems that the entire world seems to be facing \nat the moment i don't belong to a gym but i go jogging usually i go jogging four times a week \nand i also go in the morning because for me it's the best time to exercise because it keeps me awake all day but at \nthe moment i don't do any other exercise \nwow just the running just the running so what do you do to \nkeep fit many things but i think discipline is one of the most important things \nyou need to be a disciplined person is it hard to become a disciplined \nperson a little bit disciplined person but saying that it's not hard to be \ndisciplined because you do things that you like to do for example i do yoga and i enjoy yoga so \nevery day i get up in the morning and i do an hour of yoga and this is very good for your body well \nso basically one of the pillars of your way of staying healthy is to have the \ndiscipline to exercise regularly but it doesn't have to be strenuous just \nlittle things a little bit of exercise every day something simple something easy \nsomething you like to do whether it's walking or whether it's riding your bicycle to work instead of \ntaking the subway or yeah doing some yoga \ni guess you are a sporty person is that right not really just a little bit of exercise \na few days a week and it will help you stay fit and healthy do you have a healthy diet reasonably \nhealthy i'm semi-vegetarian so i don't eat meat i only eat fish and i eat lots of fruits \nand vegetables have you ever eaten fast food \nwell i also like my junk food and usually once a day i eat either potato chips or cake \nso yeah i have a balanced diet what kind of fruits do you like to eat \nwell i like all fruits i love all fruits except pineapple \ni hate pineapple i don't know why i just don't like pineapple i don't like \nthe taste i don't like to chew it it just feels funny but i love apples i love bananas i love \noranges i usually have an apple every morning for breakfast it's very easy to eat \nand i just love apples because you can take them to school you can eat them quickly they're very \neasy to eat me too i also like oranges and i love \norange juice so sometimes i make fresh orange juice in my kitchen \nand i love to eat bananas and strawberries together so my favorite snack is to cut up some \nbananas and then cut up some strawberries and mix them together and then eat them \nwell it sounds like you really do like a lot of fruits \noh yeah i do [Music] \nin the restaurant max is going to propose marriage to sophie \nin

\n[Music] hi son how was your first day of \nuniversity it's good dad but i have to admit that \nit was quite different from when i had expected really how was it different \nwell i had some strange experiences i was baffled to see students playing \noutdoor and indoor games and enjoying radio programs during class hours \nwow that's awesome students are free in their movements these days \nyes dad there is no restriction on uniforms people can register their own class \nschedule they can do things according to their choice \nso how is the campus i was very much delighted to see that the grand \nlibrary of the university where i could find all the books on every subject and \nthe laboratory is fully equipped i can't wait to perform experiments there wow that's great \nyou kids these days are so lucky with the infrastructure like that you can study so much more \neffectively so did you make any new friends \nnot yet but i found all the newly admitted students in the high spirits \nthey were all happy to make friends i will attend a meeting for new students \nand hopefully i will have some new friends and what about your new teachers \nmy new teachers are quite different from my high school teachers too they treat us like adults because you're \nall 18 and over you have full responsibilities for your actions from now on \ni know dad i'm so excited to start my university life \ngood luck son i remember my first day at stanford \nit was a sunny and bright day i woke up early and i spent a lot of \ntime choosing what i wanted to wear i felt excited and at the same time i \nwas very nervous because i don't know anybody and i was lost \nso what did you do i didn't know how to get to my classroom \ni had to ask one person about the building where i was going to take classes \nand luckily he was going to the same class as i was this person was very nice and told me \nthe right direction was that the day you met uncle ted \nyes he is my first and best friend from university he sat next to me in that class and we \nhad to do a group project together then we became best friends \ni think that it is natural that on the first day we feel nervous but things always have a happy ending \ni'm always going to remember that day because i had the opportunity to meet more people \nand most importantly i met the best friends that i have ever had don't worry son you will meet the best \nfriends at university thanks dad [Music] \nsituation 2 mike is a freshman he meets jacob a junior and asks for his \nadvice about university life [Music] \nhey are you new here i'm mike i'm a freshman \nno i'm a junior i'm jacob nice to meet you oh i'm sorry i didn't know \nwhere do you come from jacob i'm from miami how about you i'm from la \nwhat is your major i'm studying computer science \nwow that's cool my major is english literature \none of the biggest reasons why i chose that is that i want to be a writer \noh wow i hope i can work as a computer engineer after i graduate \ni'm so nervous about the next semester i'm afraid of failing i have test \nanxiety how about you believe me i still have \nconcerns too but don't worry do you want some advice \nsure thank you what was your biggest fear before you began your freshman year \nof university i worried that schoolwork would be too hard \ni wouldn't be able to keep up or i wouldn't know the correct answer when called on in class \nbut everyone makes mistakes don't worry but what should i do if i fall behind in \nmy classes if deadlines are fast approaching and you're behind on your work \nyou should structure your time take notes do extra homework ask your friends \nthings that you don't understand thanks you make me feel so much better \nbut how do i make the most effective notes before you even think about heading to \nclass make sure that you've read all the pre-assigned reading from your professor \ngo to class with a positive attitude and pay attention experiment with different taking notes \ntechniques to find one that's right for you [Music] should i take part in a club or student \norganization personally i think taking part in one can be a rich \nand rewarding experience you can find new friends that likely share the same interests \nare you a member of any student organization and what clubs should i participate in \ni'm the english book club and i think there are many student clubs and \norganizations for different majors and departments such clubs can be a lot of fun as well \nas a great academic resource for you great can i ask you a personal question \nwhat's your biggest motivation for your university life because i know that on average a student \nwith a university education will make more money throughout his or her lifetime than a student without one but \nit's not easy to stay motivated in school what should i do if i lose interest in \nstudying you should design a life plan and commit to your dreams \nthink about it if your life was as good as it could be what would it look like design a road \nmap keep this map in mind thank you one final question what's the \nbest advice you would tell a friend who is now entering university \nset high personal and academic standards for yourself believe in yourself realize that school \nis work it's not playtime settle for nothing less than your very \nbest thank you for your advice i think i'm ready to start my university life \nwishing you lots of success as you begin your new journey you can always talk to me text me if you \nneed help sure see you later bye \n[Music]

is a \npomeranian he's only one-year-old oh interesting palms are known for being \nsmart curious and energetic yes but pomeranians tend to be \nsuspicious around strangers and their small size makes large people \nand animals especially intimidating to them and they can be aggressive so may not be \nthe best choice for families with small kids really i didn't know these small guys \ncan cause such problems yeah but i had him since he was a \nnewborn and playing with him helps me relax so he is like family to me i know that \nfeeling dogs are a great company and very loyal \nwe should go to the park together tomorrow yeah sure maybe 5 pm our dogs can \nplay together ok see you then bye see ya \n[Music] john and chuck go to a pet shop to buy a \npuppy for john's daughter thank you chuck for coming here with me \nmy daughter loves puppies so i really want to buy her one for her birthday \nno problem john i'm glad i can help \nhi guys what can i help you with hi i'm looking for a puppy for my little \ndaughter great do you have anything you want in particular [Music] \num not yet but i think i want one that is friendly and not aggressive \nsuitable for small kids we have these golden retriever puppies \nthey are confident smart kind and loyal dogs \nthey are extremely patient which makes them a perfect match for kids [Music] \nyes and they love to play meaning your kid will fall in love instantly \nthat's good do they need any special care well yes they need proper care for their \nglorious golden coats which require twice weekly brushing \num my wife and i are very busy i don't think we have time for that \nwhat about these little guys here [Music] these are poodles they are great for \nkids with allergies as they shed very little but their coat requires scheduled grooming \nokay how about these oh these newfoundlands are considered to \nbe one of the most intelligent breeds in the world and these dogs just happen to love \nchildren and are very protective of them yes i heard this breed is gentle kind \nand patient almost like the mother teresa of dogs \nyes that's true but they best suit a family with large open spaces \nand they are known to drool and shed excessively so their long coats will also require \nregular grooming and upkeep um we live in an apartment so we don't have \nenough space for large dogs oh how about a beagle these are small in \nsize and have a calm temperament if your kids love the outdoors this \nbreed will fit right in oh they're so cute and bright i think \nyour daughter will love it yeah i think so too smart friendly \nand happy the beagle usually gets along with other pets too \ni think this is a perfect choice for my kid in my house \ni would take this chocolate tree puppy is it a female or a male wonderful \nthis is a male puppy so he can grow up to 22 and a half pounds to 24 and a quarter \npounds good do you have any tips for raising him \nthis guy is not picky he eats a lot and you should bring him outside for a walk \nfrequently thank you i will take good care of it \ngreat thank you so much if you have any problems or questions just ask me thank you \ni will bring him home to show him to my

see you later i'm so excited to see your cat \nbye see you next week \nlife then now samuel and thomas they are discussing \nthe changes in their life i suppose one of the biggest turning points in my life \nwas when i moved from our hometown to the capital city what happened at that time i was 14 \nyears old when i migrated i had to leave my school friends \nrelatives known places and start living in a place where i had no friends \nno one to visit and no known place for playing or outing \nthat should be a frustrating experience for you but i made new friends very quickly and \nmy teachers were very helpful as well but one problem is that i could \nnot secure even a top 10 position in my new school while i was a top scorer in my previous \nschool i know that you used to be a smart kid \nyes so i started studying harder visit the library more and read a \nreference book more than once do you think it was good for you \nnow i think it was really good i shrink my time playing games and took part in \nfootball well those changes helped you study more \nlearn more and remain healthy yeah i found that some of the health related problems \nthat i used to have are no longer bothering me also i'm so glad that i started reading books \nas it gave a certain kind of confidence boost by teaching me a lot of unknown and amazing \nthings about this world for me i think i am not healthier than i \nwas about 10 years ago why do you think so lately i have been \nso busy that i have not been taking enough time to exercise or cook healthy food \ndo you think you will have a healthy diet soon i am having a plan for it i'm going to \nclean out my fridge all of my favorite unhealthy foods and begin cooking homemade meals \ni think i will also drink two liters of water a day instead of soft drinks [Music] \nto lose weight i registered at my local gym and started to work out at least three times a week i felt stronger and \nhappier than ever before i rarely got sick and my skin also looked brighter \ni can see that on your face i think i regained my self-confidence i \nam now much more comfortable being photographed when i was a teenager \ni mainly subsisted on fast foods such as fried chicken hamburgers or crisps \ni put on weight rapidly so i think now is the time to start my weight loss \njourney or i will become overweight \nthat's true we are older we should be healthier right okay what about stress \nare you more stressed now than you were three years ago that's a hard question i'm probably \nabout the same so i wouldn't say that i'm more stressed now \nbut three years ago i was finishing my bachelor's degree so that was also a stressful time \nand lately i've been quite busy with my work so i'm probably at the same stress level as \nthree years ago i think i'm now not as stressed as i was \nin the past actually because i worry less so before i was more stressed because i worried \nabout everything and now i've learned to let it go let things go i don't let them bother me so how do you \nusually reduce stress actually there are many things that can make me happy \nhanging out with friends and having some coffee or being given a small gift helps me let off some steam \nor just the feeling of trying a good dish brings me happiness \nto me participating in an outdoor of sport such as basketball is a great way to \ncope with stress it refreshes my mind and cheers me up a lot \nbesides cooking delicious dishes for the family also helps me feel relaxed after stressful hours at my workplace \nperhaps now we have more stress because of the heavy workload and related responsibilities at the \nworkplace some people may have to face problems related to the financial burdens \nin which they may not have enough money to pay for their increasing house rent \nthere's a lot more to think about in the future we are older now so we are more worried \nabout money but maybe in the next 10 years job security things like that \nso sadly i'm a little more worried about that right everything will be fine \nhow about you are you more worried about your future these days i'm quite sure i have a good job and i \nlike the place i live so i don't feel too worried about what i will be doing next year \nor even seven years but we should probably plan ahead a bit more \nbut anyway what comes will come well this is a healthy attitude to have \nare there any changes in our town i think it developed significantly in \nthe last 10 years did it become industrialized yes it did \ni think industrialization is beneficial to our residents and to the local economy since jobs have \nbeen generated but it also brings so much pollution \nthink we are paying the price now for converting our agricultural lands to industrial \nthe living cost is now undeniably high too noise pollution is incredible \nyou know now i am getting used to the crowd in the wisdom city so basically our city has progressed but \nthere are still underlying issues that need to be improved anyway i think we are happier now than \nwe were previously definitely we don't have to think about studying at school anymore \nyes and we are happy with our jobs families and friends and i have more free time now so i can \nspend more time on entertainment too congratulations you must help with the \nstress level as well yes i think i'm having a balanced life \n[Music]
