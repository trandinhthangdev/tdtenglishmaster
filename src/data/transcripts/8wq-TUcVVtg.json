it's still in stock or not \nah I found the blue sneakers that you want amazing I'll take them \nI think I will also pay for these boots \nAt the cinema \nat the cinema [Music] \na day I'm beat because of shopping now but it was fun right \ncouldn't agree more by the way what time is it now it's 1pm do you want to eat something \nI'm not that hungry but popcorn sounds good if you want to eat popcorn we should go \nto the cinema good idea but are there any box office hits now \nif you are into sci-fi Avatar is popular at the moment hmm what about horror \nthere are some if I'm not mistaken but I don't want to watch scary movies \nall right I forgot you're frightened of ghosts there's a comedy called hello Teddy Bear \nwhich is also very interesting wanna give it a go I love comedy let's go \n[Music] \nthat was so hilarious right yeah I couldn't stop laughing because of \nthe funny plot exactly and the cast was also amazing \nI think most of them are newbies in the film industry but their facial expressions lived up to my expectations \nand I didn't expect there would be a plot twist in a comedy but there was \nI laughed so hard when the wife found out that her husband was betraying her behind her back all the time \nI know right I would definitely recommend that film to my friends \n[Music] travel planning \nTravel planning \nhello how do you do Lisa \nJustin oh hi I'm good you I feel much better now that I hear your \nvoice I wonder if I can come over to your place now oh absolutely what time will you come \nin about five minutes because I'm quite near here OMG five minutes okay \n[Music] \nhi Justin make yourself at home wow your house is so clean and well \norganized it's nothing much so why do you want to visit me \nactually I want to make a traveling plan with you for next week ah we have a one week vacation next week \nright you still remember it do you want to go on a holiday with me \nwhy not I've actually been thinking about asking you to the beach with me \nbeaches what a great idea yeah but first how long do you want to \ngo traveling I think a three-day break would be great all right then I found a resort near the \nbeach in Malibu their Spa service is top-notch and you can even join their free yoga and \nmeditation classes wow sounds interesting \nbut actually I would love to go on an adventure with you do you want to try to go snorkeling or \nsurfing instead wow I've never thought about them \nbut I think it's gonna be marvelous yeah and I also want to try some local \nseafood with you I know a seafood market near the
