I can't stand doing this homework \nwhat's wrong my boy is there anything you don't understand \nyes Dad actually there are a lot of things about gas stations that I can't get at all \ngas stations wow yeah I have to memorize the vocabulary list \nlike gas pumps gas cap and also all types of fuels blah blah blah \nbut I've never experienced going to a gas station before so it's all Greek To \nMe [Music] interesting I think I can help you \nmy car's on E now so maybe I can drive you to the gas station \nwhat does on E mean that when my car is running out of fuel it \nmeans my car's on E does e mean empty \nyes well done bill so we're gonna go to the gas station to \nadd more fuel exactly let's go \nhair Bill have a look at the fuel gauge can you guess what the function is \n[Music] I can see the indicator pointing near the e [Music] \nyep and you just explained to me that e represents an empty tag \nso do you know what F on the gauge mean does it mean full tank \nBingo good job my son [Music] I got it \nso you have to check the gauge to know the amount of fuels left in the vehicle's tank \nexactly bill now let's go to the gas station you'll have a chance to learn more \nvocabulary [Music] here we are at the gas station \ndo you know any synonyms for gas station can you give me some hints \nwell this one is a public place that's near a highway Motorway or Expressway \npeople usually stop there to go to the restrooms buy some food or refuel \nhuh I know what it is is it a rest area Bingo keep going \n[Music] all right follow me young boy this is the gasoline pump \nwhat do you think about this machine I guess just like its name we can pump \ngasoline or diesel into our vehicles right well done \nnow I'll open the fuel door and remove the gas cap to access the gas tank \n[Music] so does the fuel door mean the door to the gas tank \nand we have to open or take off the gas cap to add fuel \nthat's right and basically we have three types of fuels right \ncan you name them yes I can but I have no idea what they mean \nit's okay tell me one by one the first one is unleaded or regular gas \nall right so a leaded gasoline means there is no lead in it \nis it because lead is harmful to our environment you know it my boy \nmany people including me usually go for regular unleaded gas \ncan you tell me the other two types of gas they are plasticus and premium gas \nwell done what about diesel fuel dad well diesel is different from gasoline \nit's only used for vehicles having diesel engines it can produce high energy for big \nmachines so gasoline engines are used for more lightweight Vehicles than diesel ones \nprecisely for example our car has a gasoline engine \nnow we can use the gas nozzle to refill the fuel easily \nhow can we pay for the service dad we can pay with a card of the pump \ncan we pay in cash of course we can pay either by cash or \ncard at the counter in the store do you want to go inside and pay there \nyes I want to really try \nwow it looks like a convenience store well it is a small grocery store son \npeople say this is one of the best parts of a road trip amazing it has snacks and candy too \ncan I buy some dad [Music] very well but we have to do your gas \nstation homework okay okay thank you Dad they look so colorful can I walk around \nplease yes of course one of the best things about a gas \nstation is that it's integrated with a convenience store you can see a lot of food beverages or \neven lottery tickets here wow so what are these dad \nah they are motor oil and auto parts what is motor oil used for \nit helps our cars run smoothly how about the auto parts dad are they \ncomponents of a car you got it those components can help you repair \nsome parts of a car do you want to know what else we can do in this service area \ndefinitely [Music] \nwell they can wash our windshield if it gets too dirty it also has a coolant service \n[Music] does it mean they will cool down our car you could say so \nantifreeze mixed with water helps you control the extreme temperatures of your car \nwow so helpful if you feel like your car tires might \nsoon have a blowout they can also check the tire pressure for you \nI didn't know there were so many services at the gas station now you got it \nall right before we leave the station can you tell me what's the difference between self-service and full service \nI think self-service means we can refill the gas by ourselves but for the full service an attendant \nwill help us good job now let's go home and review what you've \nlearned [Music] \nFisher gas station will work I'm all set dad in exercise number one you have to \nreorder the letters what do you think about p a g p m s u \nis that gas Pond to refill gasoline or diesel \nbingo

\nnow those two are the easiest ones l u l f s e v i r e c and \nf e l s s e v i r e c \nthey must be full service and self-service great job \nfinally we have a phrasal verb here l i l f p u \nhmm I think it's Phil up correct \ndo you know what it means it means to put the maximum amount of fuel in the gas tank \nso proud of you hooray we've just done the first exercise \nand next in exercise number two you have to reorder and complete those sentences \nany ideas about oil Tim the checked \ngauge it must be tin checked the oil gauge \nperfect \nhow about fumes on is my car running \nmy car is running on fumes right well done my son \nRunning on Fumes means you almost run out of fuel I'll memorize that phrase \nhow about gauge gas vehicles uh tank in \nLeft the show's amount the of fuel \nwow this one is so long the gasket shows the amount of fuel in a \nvehicle's tank left quite close you have to say the amount \nof fuel left \nah I got it okay Bill three more to go unleaded I \nguess we'll need worth of 25 dollars \nI think it is I will need 25 worth of \nunleaded gas that's right \nremember to put your money in the correct type of gas that you choose okay Dad \nnext one is tank owl gas Obin the the \nfuel access door two and cap remove the \ngas \nis that I'll open the fuel door and remove the gas cap to access the gas \ntank correct \nlet's move on to the last one

\nlike this when you introduce yourself you need to introduce your name age the university \nyou have attended and the orientation of yourself what do you mean when you say the \norientation of myself orientation of yourself means what your career goals are in the future \nyou can tell employers what you're passionate about and why oh I see \nwhat they want to know about is my orientation at work can you wait a moment for me to take \nnotes sure take your time \nokay what's next the next question they may ask is why \nare you applying for this position how would you answer this question \nbecause I really like this job this is my dream job and the salary is \npretty high no you shouldn't answer like that \nyou should avoid the answer like I just really need a job or I need money \nwhy is that so because when the employer asks this question what they really want to know \nis how much you know about their company how this role fits into your career plan \nso how should I answer you need to spend time researching the company \nand select a few key factors to incorporate into your answer to demonstrate that you are a good fit \nlet them know that their values are aligned with

on experience you can talk about the experiences and \nactivities you've had at University related to this job is it okay to say that \nthe employer asks this question because they want to make sure that you can do the job \nas long as you show that you have skills qualified for the job that would be fun \nokay I'll keep this in mind what else and most job interviews candidates will \nbe asked to describe their strengths and weaknesses let's think about that what are your \nstrengths and weaknesses how should I answer the question your strengths and weaknesses should \nreflect the requirements of the job strengths are the opportunity for you to \nexpress more about yourself and weaknesses are areas you need to improve on \nbut don't let your weaknesses sound like they will impede your performance so that's how it is \nnow I know how to answer those questions thanks for your advice you have saved my \nlife you're welcome these are some common questions that you often answer when interviewing \nto have a better answer you should carefully research the company and the job position you apply for \nthe most important thing is to show the employer your good attitude and confidence when interviewing \nI have noted carefully and feel more confident now thank you so much \ngood luck with the interview just do your best thank you \n[Music] \nplease come in you've come so early

activities at University specifically I volunteered was part of \nthe student council and part of the managing team of the design marketing Club \nwhat are your weaknesses I think my weakness is that
