hungry now now there are some kiwis and apples in the \nfridge you can eat them but I want spaghetti Mom it's too late for that you \ncan't eat spaghetti now it will ruin your teeth and make you fatter you know you're not in shape Tom what about \ncookies cookies are not acceptable either you can only eat fruit honey or \nyou can go back to your room with nothing fine I will take some apples

good kid [Music] \nTom hello Dr Henry my name is Lena and this is my son Tom we have booked a \nmonth monthly checkup for him with you hello Mrs Lita and Tom how's your day \nTom I don't feel good because my mom made me stop playing video games and eating to bring me \n[Music] here don't worry I won't take much of your time you just need to answer some \neasy questions and do some tests and after that you can go back home and \ncontinue to play your games and eat whatever you like that sounds good to me \nall right the first question how frequently do you exercise I don't remember exactly maybe \na month ago yesterday my mom asked me to go for a walk with her but I was busy playing games at that time all right \nwhat do you usually have in your meals my mom always wants me to eat more vegetables and fruits but I just like \nfried chicken pizza and hamburgers because they are so yummy I eat them four times a week I understand the last \nquestion here how do you feel about your body recently I mean did something \nunusual happen I'm not sure about that I feel hungry all the time I also get \neasily frustrated angry and upset especially when someone jokes about my \nappearance and I'm tired I don't have enough energy to join outside activities with my friends at school I think I see \nyour problem I will have a talk with your mother later for you I have some \nsuggestions I think you should do more activities with your friends or your mom \nfor example walking running cycling those activities are not only \nrelaxing and interesting but also help boost your emotions and your health and \nI think your mother is Right eating vegetables is much better for you than eating chicken pizza and hamburgers once \nI tried to eat broccoli but it was disgusting let's give it another try boy \nthis time you should try to make it grilled broccoli I believe you'll like that taste I don't think so now thank \nyou Tom I need to take a little bit of your blood for a checkup and calculate your blood pressure could you follow \nyour mom to the room at the end of the corridor I'm scared I don't want tests \ndoctor don't be scared Boy by the way we have chocolate for you in that room you can \nhave one if you follow my instructions really yay okay let's go \n[Music] Tom dental \n[Music] \noffices um hello good morning sir what can I help you \nwith I have an

on your \nleft side when opening that door Jesus turns out I got to open the \ndoor I thought it was the end of the hall so I came [Music] \nback home \nhealthcare you got a minute yeah sure what's wrong well I think we should think about \ngetting a family doctor what do you think family doctor why do you bring \nthis up now because a doctor is what we need right now duh it makes no sense why the \nhospital is not very far from here though what do you mean why Home Health \nCare is essential especially for our little Mimi and I don't want to put off my \nplans to spend the whole day at the hospital Ben gosh here we go again \nit'd be more convenient and time-saving to have a family doctor don't you think \nwaiting at the hospital Jesus it sucks public hospitals are even \nworse come on it's not that [Music] \nhorrible school health \nservices Dr Hazel oh gosh what happened are you okay \ndear my head hurts so bad he fell when we were playing on the \nswings he got bruises all over

cosmetic \nsurgery after the nose job last month I just want to have a LA's body without \nany imperfections this is selflove or maybe you should try to \nlearn to accept those imperfections yeah I think you're pretty even without all those for real Susie's \nright don't be so insecure about your face or your body well maybe I'm just obsessed with \nplastic surgery and cosmetics makeup can make you feel good about yourself but too much sometimes \ndoes not really help you know right you've got tons of other things to care \nabout I mean looks aren't \n[Music] everything Optical \ncenters this is insane three times on a roll this week how can you be so clumsy \nMike it's not my fault Mom the glasses are too fragile \nthough yeah that's why you should have taken care of them I couldn't even see \nthings clearly with those glasses everything's blurry Jesus your myopia is getting \nworse all you do is play video games you should read more books \ninstead but reading too much is also not good for my eyes though don't you dare \ntalk back to me I got to take you to the optical centers again and \nagain because of your broken glasses Jesus oh Mom look those glasses are dope \ncan I have them those are way too big for you they'll slip off your \nface they're not going to fall off I'll be careful mom I promised no means no Mike try these \non these look weird I look like a dumb nerd nonsense look at these \ntemples they are built to last they're perfect for you no way everyone will \nmake fun of me with this pair of glasses it says who stop acting so \nchildish Mike I think

recovered in about a week or two oh thank God I am fed up with using \nthe crutch when I'm moving it's so inconvenient I know but using a crutch \nhelps you fix the leg and it's good for recovering I got it I will try my \nbest there's nothing much for your case I'll prescribe medicin for you this time \nwill be a little different okay thank you hope you get well soon see you next \nweek to check this leg again I hope this leg will be totally recovered next \nweek right [Music] \nat the [Music] \nzoo did you hear about what happened at the zoo \nyesterday no what happened it's crazy a few animals \nmanaged to escape from their enclosures oh my goodness are they \ndangerous animals did anyone get get hurt luckily no one got hurt and most of \nthe animals were non-threatening like a group of small monkeys and a couple of goats from the petting \nzoo well that's a relief but it must have been quite a scene with animals wandering around the \ncity definitely the zookeepers and local authorities worked together to round \nthem up they even had to temporarily close the park to ensure everyone's safety \nhow did the animals manage to escape in the first place it seems there was a tree that \nfell during a storm damaging the perimeter fence in a section of the zoo \nit's a reminder of the importance of maintaining the enclosures and being prepared for unexpected \nevents I'm sure the zoo staff learned a valuable lesson from this \nincident I hope they take extra precautions to prevent something like this from happening again \nI'm sure they will the safety of both the animals and the visitors is their top \npriority it's a relief that everything was resolved without any harm definitely I'm planning to visit \nthe zoo next week when everything is back to normal it'll be interesting to see how \nthe animals are doing that sounds like a great idea I'll join \nyou I'm curious to see the zoo's response to this incident and how theyve improved \nsecurity how about we wrap up our visit to the Aviary I enjoy watching Birds especially \nthe colorful and exotic ones sounds like a delightful way to end \nthe zoo trip let's head to the Aviary and see those beautiful birds so that's the \nplan at the gym [Music] \nthese deadlifts are really getting intense today my back is feeling the \nburn tell me about it deadlifts are fantastic for overall strength but they \ncan be tough I've been working on my form it's crucial to get it right especially with \nheavy weights make sure to keep the form to prevent any injuries \nabsolutely speaking of form I noticed you were doing those pull-ups with such smooth \ncontrol do you have any tips for improving my pull-up form pull-ups can be challenging but \nthey're fantastic for upper body strength focus on engaging your lats and \ncore and try to avoid swinging if you're struggling you can \nuse resistance bands to assist you until you build up more string great advice I'll definitely try \nthe resistance bands to help me work my way up to unassisted \npull-ups and don't forget to listen to your body it's essential to give yourself adequate rest and recovery \ntime you're right it's easy to get caught up in pushing hard but rest is \njust as crucial for progress and if you ever need a spotter \nor want to try some new exercises don't hesitate to ask thanks I appreciate \nthat no problem at all we're all on this fitness journey \ntogether let's keep pushing ourselves and celebrating each other's \n[Music] achievements at the train station \n[Music] wow it's quite busy at the train
