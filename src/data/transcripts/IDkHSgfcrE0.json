\nall right the first question \nhow frequently do you exercise \ni don't remember exactly \nmaybe one month ago \nyesterday my mom asked me to go for a \nwalk with her but \ni was busy playing games at that \ntime all right \nwhat do you usually have in your meal \nmy mother always wants me to eat more \nvegetables and fruit \nbut i just like fried chicken \npizza and hamburgers because they are so \nyummy i eat them four times a week \ni understand \nthe last question here \nhow do you feel about your body recently \ni mean does something unusual happen \ni'm not sure about that \ni feel hungry all the time \ni also easily get frustrated angry and \nupset \nespecially when someone jokes about my \nappearance \ni also easily feel tired and don't have \nenough energy to join outside activities \nwith my friends at school \n[Music] \ni think i can see your problem \ni will have a talk with your mother \nlater \nfor you i have some suggestions \ni think you should join more activities \nwith your friends or your mom \nfor example \nwalking \nrunning \ncycling \nthose activities are not only relaxing \nand interesting \nbut also help boost your emotions and \nyour health \n[Music] \nand i think your mother is right \neating vegetables is much better for you \nthan eating chicken \npizza and hamburgers \ni once tried to eat broccoli \nthey are disgusting to me \nlet's have another try boy \nthis time you should try to make grilled \nbroccoli \ni believe you will like its taste \ni don't think so \nnow thank you tom i need to take out a \nlittle bit of your blood for checkup and \ncalculate your blood pressure \ncould you follow your mom to the room at \nthe end of the corridor \ni'm scared \ni don't want that doctor \ndon't be scared boy \nby the way we have chocolates for you in \nthat room \nyou can have one if you follow my \ninstructions \nis that real \nyay \nokay \nlet's go tom \n[Music] \nthanks for watching \ndon't forget to like share \ncomment
