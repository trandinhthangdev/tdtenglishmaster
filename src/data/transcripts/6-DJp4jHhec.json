as you have to finish this work \nbefore tet \nplease give me a reason mom \naccording to vietnamese opinion \nwe shouldn't sweep the house or empty \nout rubbish on the first day of the year \nto avoid \nluck and benefits going with it so \nthat's why you must clean up before tet \nmoreover you'll feel relaxed when \nentering a spotless \nand beautiful house during tet right \nrational i'll

\nabsolutely but not too much \nhe wants to be independent in every \naspect \nso he wants to move up the career ladder \nas soon as possible \ni like his point \ni can take some comfort when hearing \nthat \nbut alice you must remember one thing \nfor me \nit is said that love makes blind \nso don't be too blind yes i'll remember \nit \ni love you mom i love you too \noh my god now it's 3 p.m i'm
