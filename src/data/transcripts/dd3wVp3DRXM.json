okay \nwill you sell the stocks as well \nno actually i will hold yours \ni hope you won't regret it \nweeks later \nbrain lucy and samantha are investing \nstocks in their own ways \nbut the result is \nlucy who is always afraid of investing \nin companies that are doing bad \neventually invested in a company that's \nseriously running downhill because she \ndoesn't even know how to read a business \nreport \nbrian who strictly follows the buy low \nsell high principal \nactually turned out to buy high sell low \nbecause of his panic \nand samantha who always mentions \nsolidity first \nturns out to have the most uncertain \ninvestment with her random portfolio \nand me who tried to hold the three \nstocks have gained 300 profit on the \ninvestment \n[Music] \nlife then now \nsamuel and thomas \nthey are discussing the changes in their \nlife \ni suppose one of the biggest turning \npoints in my life \nwas when i moved from our hometown to \nthe capital city \nwhat happened at that time \ni was 14 years old when i migrated \ni had to leave my school \nfriends \nrelatives \nknown places \nand start living in a place where i had \nno friends \nno one to visit \nand no known place for playing or outing \nthat should be a frustrating experience \nfor you \nbut i made new friends very quickly and \nmy teachers were very helpful as well \nbut one problem is that i could not \nsecure even a top 10 position in my new \nschool while i was a top scorer in my \nprevious school \ni know that you used to be a smart kid \nyes i so i started studying harder visit \nthe library more and read a reference \nbook more than once \ndo you think it was good for you \nnow i think it was really good \ni shrink my time playing games and you \ntook part in football \n[Music] \nwell those changes helped you study more \nlearn more and remain healthy \nyeah i found that some of the health \nrelated problems that i used to have are \nno longer bothering me \nalso i'm so glad that i started reading \nbooks as it gave a certain kind of \nconfidence boost by teaching me a lot of \nunknown and amazing things about this \nworld \nfor me i think \ni am not healthier than i was about 10 \nyears ago \nwhy do you think so \nlately i have been so busy that i have \nnot been taking enough time to exercise \nor cook healthy food \ndo you think you will have a healthy \ndiet soon \ni am having a plan for it \ni'm going to clean out my fridge all of \nmy favorite unhealthy foods and begin \ncooking homemade meals \ni think i will also drink 2 liters of \nwater a day instead of soft drinks \n[Music] \nto lose weight i registered at my local \ngym and started to work out at least \nthree times a week \ni felt stronger and happier than ever \nbefore \ni rarely got sick and my skin also \nlooked brighter \ni can see that on your face \ni think i regained my self-confidence \ni am now much more comfortable being \nphotographed \nwhen i was a teenager i mainly subsisted \non fast foods such as fried chicken \nhamburgers or crisps \noh i put on weight rapidly \nso i think now is the time to start my \nweight loss journey \nor i will become overweight \nthat's true we are older we should be \nhealthier \nright okay \nwhat about stress are you more stressed \nnow than you were three years ago \nthat's a hard question \ni'm probably about the same \nso i wouldn't say that i'm more stressed \nnow \nbut three years ago i was finishing my \nbachelor's degree so that was also a \nstressful time \nand lately i've been quite busy with my \nwork so \ni'm probably at the same stress level as \nthree years ago \ni think i'm \nnow not as stressed as i was in the past \nactually because i worry less \nso before i was more stressed because i \nworried about everything \nand now i've learned to let it go \nlet things go \ni don't let them bother me \n[Music] \nso how do you usually reduce stress \nactually there are many things that can \nmake me happy \nhanging out with friends and having some \ncoffee or being given a small gift helps \nme let off some steam \nor just the feeling of trying a good \ndish brings me happiness \nto me \nparticipating in an outdoor of sport \nsuch as basketball is a great way to \ncope with stress \nit refreshes my mind and cheers me up a \nlot \nbesides cooking delicious dishes for the \nfamily also helps me feel relaxed after \nstressful hours at my workplace \nperhaps now we have more stress because \nof the heavy workload and related \nresponsibilities at the workplace \nsome people may have to face problems \nrelated to the financial burdens \nin which they may not have enough money \nto pay for their increasing house rent \nthere's a lot more to think about in the \nfuture \nwe are older now so we are more worried \nabout money \nbut maybe in the next 10 years job \nsecurity things like that \nso sadly i'm a little more worried about \nthat \nright everything will be fine \nhow about you are you more worried about \nyour future these days \ni'm quite sure i have a good job and i \nlike the place i live \nso i don't feel too worried about what i \nwill be doing next year or even seven \nyears \nbut we should probably plan ahead a bit \nmore \nbut anyway \nwhat comes will come \nwell this is a healthy attitude to have \nare there any changes in our town \ni think it developed \nsignificantly in the last 10 years \ndid it become industrialized \nyes it did \ni think industrialization is beneficial \nto our residents and to the local \neconomy since jobs have been generated \nbut it also brings so much pollution \ni think we are paying the price now for \nconverting our agricultural lands to \nindustrial \nthe living cost is now undeniably high \ntoo \nnoise pollution is incredible \nyou know now i am getting used to the \ncrowd and noise in the city \n[Music] \nso basically our city has progressed but \nthere are still underlying issues that \nneed to be improved \nanyway i think we are happier now than \nwe were previously \ndefinitely we don't have to think about \nstudying at school anymore \nyes and we are happy with our jobs \nfamilies and friends \ni have more free time now so i can spend \nmore time on entertainment too \ncongratulations \nyou must help with the stress level as \nwell \nyes i think i'm having a balanced life \n[Music]
