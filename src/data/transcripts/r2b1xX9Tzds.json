\nwilliam represents the fat team \nso anna why is it good to be thin \nin my opinion thin prevents certain \ndiseases so it is good for your health \nit is good to be thin because you can \nbuy any clothes and you can wear your \nclothes without any problems you have no \ndifficulty exercising \nyou can eat everything and do not gain \nweight \nlike chocolate chocolate is so delicious \nbut when you get fat you love chocolate \nand eat it you'll get fatter and thin is \nmore attractive \ndo you want to oppose william \nyes teacher i think thin people usually \nhave less strength than fat people \npeople with very low weight usually \nsuffer anemia fainting malnutrition etc \nsometimes it is difficult for thin \npeople to choose clothes too it does not \nequal healthy \npersonally i think fat people are also \nvery cute and charming in their own way \ndo you want to oppose anna \nmaybe you're right but do you know that \nmany fat people struggle to breathe \nheart disease is common \nsometimes tying shoes is a challenge \nwhen fat people bend down \nfat people struggle to find clothing \nthat look good on them \nsometimes they can't wear the clothes \nthey like \ni'm a girl so i understand when i won't \nbe able to wear what i like it's really \nsad \nbut if we talk about clothes \nit's like judging a person by their \nappearance \nit isn't fair how you treat people is \nmore important than how you look \nno matter how fat you are wear what you \nlike \nwhether \nit's vintage hipster girl punk gal or \nbright colors it is just fine \nfind a doctor who respects you and get \nregular \ncheckups i want to say this for anyone \nwho gets fat \nif you spend your life afraid of what \nothers think in your fat it is a life \nhave lived don't reject yourself embrace \nyourself with a daily hug a smile in the \nmirror every time you see yourself \nlove yourself first because when you \nlove yourself you will know that you \nshould lose weight or not \nwhat is good for your health \nyou speak very well william \nthank you you speak well to anna \nthanks anna and william both are awesome \nwhether fat or thin we should keep a \nbalanced weight to protect our health we \nshould exercise for a healthy body it's \nnot good to be too thin or too fat \nas william said how you treat people is \nmore important than how you look \nso if you are thin or fat it's not \nimportant \nlove yourself and respect yourself first \nbut remember to exercise regularly \n[Music] \nAppearance \nsituation four \nbasic opposite adjectives describing \nappearance \nhow does
