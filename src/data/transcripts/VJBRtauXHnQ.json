you going to do Hermione Granger \nRed Riding wolf [Music] \nthank you after months at University I still have \nno friends I tried sometimes but everything was so difficult for me \nhowever I don't understand how my little sister did it so coolly \nshe has many friends at University I can't even remember all of their names \nwe all have red hair for her it is an advantage Everyone likes her hair \nbut for me it is a disadvantage I was teased a lot because of this hair when I \nwas a kid [Music] I also have a roommate in the dormitory he always seems happy and easy going \nthough we don't talk much to each other I think he is quite a good person \nrecently I've been playing a new game called G era \nto avoid conflict I selected a female character because well my battle skill sucks and I \ncouldn't communicate or interact with my teammates in the beginning I just wanted to kill \ntime but the puzzle in this game is so cool that I'm addicted to it \nluckily I met one good teammate she is the kindest person I have ever met in \nthis game she helped me fight the battles and collect my favorite game items we \ngot along quite well I think finally I would have one friend \none of in University but she still assumes I'm a girl \nI was wondering if I could tell her the truth if she knows who I am will she be angry \nwith me and suppose I am a scammer I better hide my identity forever \nunexpectedly I must let the cat out of the bag this way \n[Music] awkward moment I know who wants to start \n[Music] okay so Ben \ncan you tell us your reason I have no reason I have no excuse for \nthat I but why did you do that do you know Ken is the owner of that \naccount I did not mean to do that everything happened by chance how \nI chose the female character with nothing on purpose I just want everyone to be friendly with \nme because they think I'm a girl Ken you know my skills are not good \nI also didn't know that account is yours I don't want to hurt you \ndo you mean everything is a coincidence yes that's all I can explain to you now \nI didn't even know Red Riding Hood was a boy too oh my Ken had a crush on your character \nand by doing this you're playing with this feelings I told you I didn't do it on purpose I \ndidn't expect things to turn into a cheating situation I'm sorry I think you may feel terrible \nnow well it is true that you heard him so bad \nbut you know I like you as a friend and I don't want to end this friendship that's why I never told you the truth \nI'm afraid you'd be mad at me and leave me alone to be honest he's right \nHermione always avoids my questions about gender and everything related to feelings \nyeah and I didn't even know you're a boy too so I don't really understand that \noh my I was deceiving myself I'm so sorry again \nthat's fine I'm glad that everything is clarified now can we still be friends Ken \nsure we can be friends from now on okay if Ken says so then I have nothing \nto say nice to meet you nice to meet you too and to make up for \nit would you guys like to eat out with me tonight sure \ntonight at 8 deal [Music] \nbrother is everything all right thank you all good now \ncool she is \noh I'm so sorry I forgot to introduce myself I'm Lily I'm Ben's little sister \nwow I should have known you guys have the same red hair \nyeah I love my red hair so much hi Lily I'm Ken Ben's roommate \nyeah Ben told me a little about you nice to meet you [Music] \ntopic have you ever been to a gas station before how many vocabulary words can you name \nat the station check out this video and learn with Bill and Adam \ngosh I can't stand doing this homework what's wrong my boy \nis there anything you don't understand yes Dad \nactually there are a lot of things about gas stations that I can't get at all \ngas stations wow yeah I have to memorize the vocabulary list \nlike gas pumps gas cap and also all types of fuels blah blah blah \nbut I've never experienced going to a gas station before so it's all Greek To Me \nmirror interesting I think I can help you \nmy car's on E now so maybe I can drive you to the gas station \nwhat does on E mean that when my car is running out of fuel it \nmeans my car's on E does e mean empty \nyes well done bill so we're gonna go to the gas station to \nadd more fuel exactly let's go \nthank you \nhair Bill have a look at the fuel gauge can you guess what the function is \n[Music] I can see the indicator pointing near the e [Music] \nyep and you just explained to me that e represents an empty tag \nso do you know what F on the gauge mean does it mean full tank \nBingo good job my son [Music] I got it \nso you have to check the gauge to know the amount of fuels left in the vehicle's tank \nexactly bill now let's go to the gas station you'll have a chance to learn more \nvocabulary [Music] here we are at the gas station \ndo you know any synonyms for gas station can you give me some hints \nwell this one is a public place that's near a highway Motorway or Expressway \npeople usually stop there to go to the restrooms buy some food or refuel \nhuh I know what it is is it a rest area Bingo keep going \n[Music] all right follow me young boy this is the gasoline pump \nwhat do you think about this machine I guess just like its name we can pump \ngasoline or diesel into our vehicles right well done \nnow I'll open the fuel door and remove the gas cap to access the gas tank \n[Music] so does the fuel door mean the door to the gas tank \nand we have to open or take off the gas cap to add fuel \nthat's right and basically we have three types of fuels right \ncan you name them yes I can but I have no idea what they mean \nit's okay tell me one by one the first one is unleaded or regular gas \nall right so a leaded gasoline means there is no lead in it \nis it because lead is harmful to our environment you know it my boy \nmany people including me usually go for regular unleaded gas \ncan you tell me the other two types of gas they are plasticus and premium gas \nwell done what about diesel fuel dad well diesel is different from gasoline \nit's only used for vehicles having diesel engines it can produce high energy for big \nmachines so gasoline engines are used for more lightweight Vehicles than diesel ones \nprecisely for example our car has a gasoline engine \nnow we can use the gas nozzle to refill the fuel easily \nhow can we pay for the service dad we can pay with a card at the pump \ncan we pay in cash of course we can pay either by cash or \ncard at the counter in the store do you want to go inside and pay there \nyes I want to really try \nwow it looks like a convenience store well it is a small grocery store son \npeople say this is one of the best parts of a road trip amazing it has snacks and candy too \ncan I buy some that [Music] very well but we have to do your gas \nstation homework okay okay thank you Dad they look so colorful can I walk around \nplease yes of course one of the best things about a gas \nstation is that it's integrated with a convenience store you can see a lot of food beverages or \neven lottery tickets here [Music] wow so what are these dad \nah they are motor oil and auto parts what is motor oil used for \nit helps our cars run smoothly how about the auto parts dad are they \ncomponents of a car you got it those components can help you repair \nsome parts of a car do you want to know what else we can do in the service area \ndefinitely [Music] \nwell they can wash our windshield if it gets too dirty it also has a coolant service \n[Music] does it mean they will cool down our car \nyou could say so antifreeze mixed with water helps you control the extreme temperatures of your \ncar wow so helpful if you feel like your car tires might \nsoon have a blowout they can also check the tire pressure for you \nI didn't know there were so many services at the gas station now you got it \nall right before we leave the station can you tell me what's the difference between self-service and full service \nI think self-service means we can refill the gas by ourselves but for the full service an attendant \nwill help us good job now let's go home and review what you've \nlearned \nare you ready to finish your gas station or work I'm all set dad \nin exercise number one you have to reorder the letters what do you think about p a g p m s u \nis that gas pump to refill gasoline or diesel bingo \nhow about p a c a \ns j \nthis is a tricky one I think it's gas cap \nyou got it \nlet's move to s a g o z \nl z e n \nis that nozzle gas no son you have to reorder the phrase \nhuh gas nozzle good job \nnow those two are the easiest ones l u l f s e v i r e c and f e l s s e v \ni r e c \nthey must be full service and self-service great job \nfinally we have a phrasal verb here l i l f p u \nH I think it's Phil up correct \ndo you know what it means it means to put the maximum amount of fuel in the gas tank \nso proud of you hooray we have just done the first exercise \nand next in exercise number two you have to reorder and complete those sentences \nany ideas about oil Tim the checked \ngauge it must be tin checked the oil gauge \nperfect \nhow about fumes on is my car running \nmy car is running on fumes right well done my son \nRunning on Fumes means you almost run out of fuel I'll memorize that phrase \nhow about gauge gas vehicles uh tank in \nLeft the show's amount the of fuel \nwow this one is so long the gasket shows the amount of fuel in a \nvehicle's tank left quite close you have to say the amount \nof fuel left \nah I got it okay Bill three more to go unleaded I \ngas will need worth of 25 dollars \nI think it is I will need 25 worth of \nunleaded gas that's right \nremember to put your money in the correct type of gas that you choose okay Dad \nnext one is tank owl gas Obin the the \nfuel access door two and cap remove the \ngas \nis that I'll open the fuel door and remove the gas cap to access the gas \ntank correct \nlet's move on to the last one check you the could oil and Hood the pop \nbro it's too tricky for me want me to help you \nyes please the correct order is you could pop the \nhood and check the oil what does pop that bud mean Dad \nhood here means the front part of your car so it means open the hood \nah then the answer is you could pop the hood and check the oil \n[Music] exactly now you've finished all the \nhomework thank you so much Dad [Music] going out with you today was really \nhelpful my teacher and classmates will be surprised at how smart I

oh gosh is it November next week time \nflies yeah I want to plan a surprise party for him \nthat's a great idea we didn't hold a party for Liam last year because he returned to his hometown \nokay do you have any ideas for it [Music] thinking of a party at his house \nno the build a party at his house it won't be a surprise party anymore so where should we hold it \nwe should rent a Homestay I know some beautiful places okay so you will take responsibility for \nbooking the place and decorating okay easy as pie \nand I will prepare food and drink shall we buy a birthday cake I could \nrecommend some bakeries I want to make it by myself are you kidding me you're not able to \nmake cookies I can try you know we should buy it anyway \ndo you know Layla yeah she is skilled at cooking especially \nbaking really I didn't know that will she help \nI will convince her no worries thank you \nwhat should we buy we need cornstarch and all-purpose flour \nokay what is next cooking oil we have it at home so we can skip it \nthen unsweetened fresh milk eggs sugar salt cream of tartar and whipping cream \nwe have salt sugar and unsweetened fresh milk at home as well we will need some \neggs okay some eggs you should go to that corner and pick up \ncream of tartar and whipping cream okay I'm done \nand what's your cake flavor strawberry okay get a box of strawberries \nso what should we do first of all I need to bake a cake \nlike sponge cake yes kind of pass me corn starch and flour \nhere you are I will help you weigh them then in a small bowl combine and mix \nthem together okay I'm done add milk and cooking oil together in a \nbowl where's the cooking oil it is in the cupboard \nhuh it's here next separate the egg whites from the yolks into two separate bowls \nit's too difficult I'm afraid the eggshells will drop into the bowl let me help you \ncool Mal beat the egg yolks with cooking oil and milk use this mixer \nokay then sift the flour into the mixture \nI'm going to use this sieve am I right yeah good job \nthen continue beating them together we will have a yellowish mixture that's it I did it \nwe have many things to do ahead what is next \nwhisk the egg whites during whisking the egg whites first form a froth \nthen add salt and cream of tartar continue whisking them until they turn \ninto thick snowy foam when should I stop when firm Peaks are formed you'll know \nyou are nearly there look at it yeah then lower the speed \nmix the two mixtures together like this \nyou're doing well final step pour them into a cake pan if there are \nlarge air bubbles knock the pan a few times to get rid of them okay I'm done \nthen bake them in the oven at 175 degrees for about 25 to 35 minutes \nwhich heating function should I choose both top and bottom heat along with the \nfan heating mode that button right yep that's right \n[Music] \nokay done baking a cake is one of the most difficult things I've tried Layla \nbecause it is your first time it is absolutely difficult when did you learn to bake cakes \nI really cannot remember the exact time around three years ago I think \nwho am I it has been a long time but it is still impossible for me to \nmaster some types of cake I don't think I can even bake one more time \ncome on it is really satisfying to see your cakes when they are out of the oven \nokay I will wait for it okay stop chatting we should make the \nfrosting right now pray it now we're waiting for the cake aren't we \nto save time we have to prepare the frosting now we can't just stare at the oven right no \nway okay I thought I had time to take a rest what should we do next \ngive me the icing sugar icing sugar I don't think it was on our \nbuying list oh my gosh I forgot to list it what should we do shall I go to the \ngrocery store right now no no regular sugar is fine it's just \nnot as good as icing sugar but it is okay okay be careful with this step \nokay I'm all ears or the whipping cream into a chilled \nbowl and begin to whisk moving the cream back and forth across \nthe bowl the cream will start turning into frothy Bubbles and then into a thick liquid \nokay I'm trying it seems quite challenging you can do it \nLayla look at it I think the whipped cream and water are separated \nlet me take a look at it here Clea ruined it calm down it's fine this is a common \nmistake what should we do now let me whisk the other cream \ncan you fix it no once whipped cream starts to separate \nwe can't reunite it so we need to throw it away no we can use it to make butter later \nspread a layer of frosting around the sides and across the top okay we're done now we decorate it with \nstrawberries oh my finally I love decorating \nbe careful with the surface of the cake okay \n[Music] \nhappy happy birthday to you happy birthday to you happy birthday dear Liam \nhappy birthday to you thanks everyone I'm so surprised \nLisa bring your birthday cake over here sure \nyou know Lisa Made It by herself really she can't even cook I'm so \ntouched Lisa be careful \noh my gosh OMG \nout of my whips oh dear it's late I have to get everything ready soon \n[Music] \nthanks for watching
