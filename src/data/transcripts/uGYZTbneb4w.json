something different \ndo you have any ideas how about scary decorations and then \nwe'll watch scary films no it's boring \nConnor what are you doing I'm reading a post about sunshine \nabandoned summer camp I also heard about it \nme too it's scary what is it \nin an abandoned Camp there is a psychopath he kidnaps people who come to \nthis camp and keeps them in his lair sounds like a horror movie \nI love horror movies I think it's just a made-up story \nit was on every social media it's not a made-up story many people reported and the police \nintervened but the police couldn't catch this psychopath so this Camp has long been \nabandoned there really was that psychopath the police would have caught him already \nno Maya if it's not true where are the missing people \nthe missing people are the ones who made up the story I have an idea for Halloween \nwhat is it we'll go to that abandoned camp \n[Music] are you serious \nall of us will go there to let Maya check it out for herself if it's true or not \nthat sounds good scary but interesting I'm in \nso Maya will you join sure why not \nand if there's no Psychopaths there all of you must treat me to a hearty meal \nagree [Music] \nMaya are you sure you want to go yeah of course \nnothing can scare me Connor okay we'll see \nwho's ready to go me me \nokay let's go [Music] \nI want to hear some more rumors about the abandoned camp yes tell me what you know Connor \nokay this is the most famous rumor I've read There was a man who didn't believe \nin the story of sunshine camp 190 decided to go to the camp all by \nhimself with his camera to prove that there is nothing known as the sunshine psychopath \nhe was never found after that the only thing police could find was his \ncamera and what they saw inside was terrifying \nwhat what did they see when he was filming around there was a \nfigure standing in the dark watching him when he noticed the psychopath instantly came toward him \nand we all know what happened after that oh my that is really scary \nif it's a rumor it's just a rumor it's not true they had the video you know \nhave you ever seen this video even if there is a video it could be \nfake or made up let's see Maya here we are \ntime to find out if it's truth or a rumor \nfind a house to store our belongings and sleeping bags okay [Music] \nhow about that one okay let's go there \nnow we go outside and make a campfire sure let's go \n[Music] I don't believe the rumors here but this \nis the perfect place to camp for Halloween yeah I like this place \nthis place creates a creepy atmosphere if that psychopath is real what should \nwe do don't worry whether he's real or not we can still fight him or run away \nbut the important thing is that he is just a rumor \nlet's play a game okay mosquito bites me too much \ndo you have insect repellent I have \ngreat where is it it's in the car I'll be right back wait for me to play \nthe game okay \n[Music] huh \nit's weird Austin hasn't come back yet \nyeah our car is nearby what took him so long \nI'll have a check on him okay be careful \nI feel a bit insecure it's fine Connor don't worry too much \nit's clear \nClaire where are you what's wrong Claire \nthe door is open it's Austin's shoes \nsomeone's kidnapped him oh my God \nhere is not safe let's go back to the house and think how to find Austin \nwhat happened there Claire I don't know I'm scared \ncalm down Claire when I got there I didn't see Austin \nanywhere all those traces made me think that something bad had happened to him \nit's the psychopath the psychopath must have taken Austin away \nwhat should we do what if something bad happens to him \nI don't think it's a psychopath maybe Austin encountered a wild animal \nMaybe what should we do call for help call our family call the \npolice or 9-1-1 sure okay \nI can't make a call there's no signal here \nmy phone also has no signal we need to do something \nbe it an animal or a psychopath Austin is in danger let's go out and try to find Austin \nthat's risky yeah what if we went missing like Austin \nokay here's the plan Connor you stay with Claire I'll go find \nAustin but that's dangerous I'll be fine \nyou too try to find a way to communicate with someone to ask for help \nokay but be careful run as fast as you can back here if there's something wrong \nwe will wait for you okay \n[Music] can't find Austin anywhere \nmaybe I should go back to Connor and Claire to think of another plan no \nno Claire Connor \n[Applause] \n[Music] [Applause] \nno don't hurt me get away [Music] \nfrom Austin Connor Claire \nall of you is is this a joke \nwe got you sorry Maya but it's so funny \nare you okay no I'm not okay at all I can't believe \nyou guys all did this because

assigned more and more work \nto Stacy gradually Barbara assigned almost all \nher work to Stacy while Stacy had to do all of Barbara's \nwork Barbara just sat there and did nothing that's excessive that girl is so bossy \nwhy did Stacy have to suffer like this [Music] \nthis report is very good you have researched the market thoroughly \nyou've been doing great lately Barbara thank you sir

I've highlighted that I'd like to talk to you about in person \nI see how did you know about this plan when I \njust gave it to Barbara every work every task you gave to \nBarbara she gave them to me what how is that possible \nshe just spends her days shopping online eating out talking on the phone with her \nboyfriend and yelling at employees she did nothing \nshe lied I did all of those things you can ask everyone in the office for \nthe truth this is the USB containing all the documents \nif she did it how can I have it and this report is also proof \nwhen has this happened since I worked
