have the word \nchallenging which means difficult in a \nway that tests your ability or \ndetermination example learning a new \nlanguage can be \nchallenging next is doubt meaning to \nfeel uncertain or lack confidence \nexample sometimes I doubt if I made the \nright decision commitment refers to a \npromise or firm decision to to do \nsomething example their commitment to \neach other was \nevident uphill battle is used to \ndescribe a task that is difficult and \nrequires a lot of effort example winning \nthe competition was an uphill \nbattle finally proximity means nearness \nin space time or \nrelationship example their desks were in \nclose proximity to each other now that \nwe've gone through some key vocabulary \nlet's listen to Emily and Sarah's \nconversation one more

absolutely it's tough but we \nboth believe it's worth the effort we're \ncommitted to making it work how do you \nhandle the loneliness that comes with \nbeing in a longdistance relationship we \ntry to stay positive and trust each \nother plus we plan visits whenever \npossible the time difference is a big \none \nEmily sometimes when I need him the most \nhe's just starting his day that sounds

\nlike communication is key in your \nrelationship definitely we've learned to \ncommunicate openly and honestly it's \nessential for keeping our bonds \n[Music] \nDiscussion about New Environment \nstrong after hearing from Emily and \nSarah I've been thinking about \nlongdistance love here's what I feel \nabout it for the first question can \nlongdistance relationships work I \nbelieve they can it's not about the \nphysical distance but rather the \nemotional closeness you maintain regular \ncommunication trust and understanding \nare key yes there will be moments of \nloneliness but overcoming these together \nstrengthens your \nbond as for the second question would I \nconsider being in a longdistance \nrelationship well for me it would be \nabout the connection with the person if \nwe share a deep understanding support \neach other's dreams and can imagine a \nfuture together then yes I would it \ntakes a lot of work you have to plan \ncommunicate and sometimes just be there \neven if it's only \nvirtually what matters is the commitment \nto face the challenges together and the \njoy of knowing you're United in \nQuestions & Answers \npurpose as we bring today's podcast to a \nclose I'd like to take a moment to \nrespond to some of the questions that \nhave come in from our listeners \nMery asked how to make \nsentences I am very struggling and \nspeaking does not come out what can I do \nfor that Mery thanks for your question \nthe key to sentence construction is \npractice start with simple sentences and \ngradually make them more complex try to \nthink in English rather than translating \nfrom your mother tongue practice \nregularly and don't be afraid to make \nmistakes they're all part of the \nlearning \nprocess now transitioning to our next \nquestion another viewer asked do you \nhave any other channels Miss Jessica \nthank you for your interest it's about \nthe other channels you can find Jessica \non yes she's expanded her teaching \nplatforms Jessica's engaging in \neducational content is now available in \nSpanish and \nChinese if you or someone you know is \nlearning in those languages be sure to \nsubscribe and stay updated with her \nlatest \nvideos and from India we have I want to \nspeak in English what should I do for \nthis please help remember the key is to \nimmerse yourself in the language \nsurround yourself with English through \nmusic movies and \nconversation practice speaking as much \nas you can with friends or through \nlanguage exchanges and consider an \nEnglish course to structure your \nlearning it's been a pleasure sharing \nthis time with you keep sending your \nquestions and we'll address them in \nupcoming episodes see you next time on \nthe 8 Minute English podcast \n[Music]
