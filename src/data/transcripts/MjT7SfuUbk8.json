is a good spot let's stop and have our picnic next to the river \ngood idea walking always makes me hungry i'm ready for lunch \nwe can sit here on the grass oh no someone forgot to throw these empty \npaper bags away there is litter everywhere \nwhy do people always leave litter around it's not a nice thing to do \nit spoils other people's picnics i think they are lazy or maybe they just \ndon't care look there are some empty cans and glass bottles under that tree too \n[Music] people should clean up before they leave \nand not leave litter lying around that's right well after our picnic let's pick up all \nthe litter we can and take it out of here okay and next week \nlet's come back with friends and pick up some more good idea \n[Music] \nLet's recycle \nlet's recycle [Music] \nhi jane have you heard about the new laws to help people recycle \ni heard about them on the news last night i don't think i like them \nthe government wants to keep the environment clean by recycling paper metal and glass \ninstead of throwing these things away but who wants to pay an extra 50 cents \neach time you buy a cup of coffee that's a lot of money 50 cents \nit's only 5 cents extra for a paper cup i thought it was 50 cents \nno it's only 5 cents don't worry and you can get your money back when you return the cup \nthat's fair well maybe the government is right after all \ni'll return all the paper coffee cups i use from now on good we all need to recycle it helps to \nkeep the environment clean [Music] \nGrowing roses \ngrowing roses [Music] \nexcuse me ma'am i have a problem with my rose bush \nit used to produce a lot of pink roses but now it doesn't produce any flowers \nat all i see that does seem like a problem \ndo the leaves on the plants look healthy not really the leaves used to be very \ngreen now most of them have turned brown well \ni think your rose bush needs some fertilizer okay what sort of fertilizer do you \nthink i should use \nthis liquid fertilizer is very good it will help make your rose leaves green \nagain then the plant should produce roses quite soon the fertilizer costs about \nten dollars how long will it take for my rose bush to recover \nabout two weeks i think great i'll take it \nthank you so much for your help you're welcome \n[Music] bird watching \nBird-watching \n[Music] i want to go bird watching tomorrow \ndo you know a good area for birds there is a quiet park near here there \nare always many beautiful birds there will i be able to see different types of \nbirds in this area yes i think so \nif you use binoculars you can see the birds even if they are far away \ngreat i have a book about all the different types of birds \nit seems as if you really like bird watching yes i do \nwould you like to come with me tomorrow no thank you \ni think bird watching is boring that's not true \nbirds are very interesting some birds have colorful feathers \nsome birds sing beautiful songs some birds make special nests to lay \neggs in really maybe i will go bird watching one day \nafter all [Music] \nscience and technology an easy way to shop \nAn easy way to shop \n[Music] \nhey ashley look at my new mp3 player \nwow it looks cool where did you buy it i bought it online at an electronics \nwebsite i'm not very good at using a computer is it hard to buy things online \nit's really easy all you do is go to the website and \nchoose the item you want to look at there are so many items to choose from \non the website after you choose what you want to buy you click on the checkout button \nthat does seem easy yes it is it only takes about a week for your item \nto come of course if you are in a hurry you can pay more to get it sent faster \ndo you pay for the item when it comes no you have to pay for it online with a \ncredit card [Music] \ncell phone messages i need to check my messages \nCell phone messages \nhow are you going to do that we are in the middle of the freeway \ni'm going to use my cell phone haven't you ever done that \nno i just use my cell phone to talk to other people [Music] now you can also use a cell phone to \nsend and receive short text messages it's very useful \nhow do you send a message that way i just use the keys on the phone to type \na short message then i press the send button it's cheaper than making a phone call \nthat's a great idea you can save both time and money that way \nright all my friends usually send me text messages now \nthanks for telling me about this i'll have to try it you're welcome i think you'll find it \nuseful [Music] \nThe blue sky \nthe blue sky [Music] \njoe asked me something about science just now but i didn't know the answer \ni'm good at science ask me okay why is the sky blue \ni'll explain it in a simple way light comes through the air from the sun in waves \nthe light is in many colors right right blue light waves are smaller than air \nmolecules they sometimes get absorbed by these molecules \nokay what happens then then the blue light waves scatter in \nmany directions your eyes see this blue light from above you after it leaves the air molecules \nso that is what makes the sky blue what happens to the other colors \nthey reflect off the things that they hit your shirt is red because our eyes see \nthe red light reflected from it now i understand why the sky is blue \n[Music] a new camera \nA new camera \n[Music] i just bought a digital camera \nwhat is wrong with your old camera nothing i bought this one because i want \nto store my pictures on my computer i see \ni can also delete pictures that are not very good i don't have to print them \ni like to print all my photos that's why i like the old cameras \noh you can print digital photos too many shops will print them for you \nreally yes you can even buy a good printer and do it at home \nthat seems easy how do you store these digital pictures \nyou can store the pictures on your computer but you might run out of space \ni save all the pictures i like on compact discs you can store more than 700 photos on \none cd great maybe i should get a digital camera too \n[Music] \nThe summer music festival \nthe summer music
