\nand Adam \ngosh I can't stand doing this homework \nwhat's wrong my boy \nis there anything you don't understand \nyes Dad \nactually there are a lot of things about \ngas stations that I can't get at all \ngas stations wow \nyeah \nI have to memorize the vocabulary list \nlike gas pumps gas cap and also all \ntypes of fuels blah blah blah \nbut I've never experienced going to a \ngas station before so it's all Greek To \nMe \nmirror \ninteresting \nI think I can help you \nmy car's on E now so maybe I can drive \nyou to the gas station \nwhat does on E mean that \nwhen my car is running out of fuel it \nmeans my car's on E \ndoes e mean empty \nyes well done bill \nso we're gonna go to the gas station to \nadd more fuel \nexactly let's go \nthank you \nFuel Gauge \nhair Bill have a look at the fuel gauge \ncan you guess what the function is \n[Music] \nI can see the indicator pointing near \nthe e \n[Music] \nup and you just explained to me that e \nrepresents an empty tag \nso do you know what F on the gauge mean \ndoes it mean full tank \nBingo good job my son \n[Music] \nI got it \nso you have to check the gauge to know \nthe amount of fuels left in the \nvehicle's tank \nexactly bill now let's go to the gas \nstation \nyou'll have a chance to learn more \nvocabulary \n[Music] \nGas Station \nhere we are at the gas station \ndo you know any synonyms for gas station \ncan you give me some hints \nwell this one is a public place that's \nnear a highway Motorway or Expressway \npeople usually stop there to go to the \nrestrooms buy some food or refuel \nhuh I know what it is is it a rest area \nBingo keep going \n[Music] \nall right follow me young boy \nthis is the gasoline pump \nwhat do you think about this machine \nI guess just like its name we can pump \ngasoline or diesel into our vehicles \nright \nwell done \nnow I'll open the fuel door and remove \nthe gas cap to access the gas tank \n[Music] \nso does the fuel door mean the door to \nthe gas tank \nand we have to open or take off the gas \ncap to add fuel \nthat's right and basically we have three \ntypes of fuels right \ncan you name them \nyes I can but I have no idea what they \nmean \nit's okay tell me one by one \nthe first one is unleaded or regular gas \nall right so a leaded gasoline means \nthere is no lead in it \nis it because lead is harmful to our \nenvironment \nyou know it my boy \nmany people including me usually go for \nregular unleaded gas \ncan you tell me the other two types of \ngas \nthey're plasticus and premium gas \nwell done \nwhat about diesel fuel dad \nwell diesel is different from gasoline \nit's only used for vehicles having \ndiesel engines \nit can produce high energy for big \nmachines \nso gasoline engines are used for more \nlightweight Vehicles than diesel ones \nprecisely for example our car has a \ngasoline engine \nnow we can use the gas nozzle to refill \nthe fuel easily \nhow can we pay for the service dad \nwe can pay with a card at the pump \ncan we pay in cash \nof course we can pay either by cash or \ncard at the counter in the store \ndo you want to go inside and pay there \nyes I want to really try \nConvenience Store \nwow it looks like a convenience store \nwell it is a small grocery store son \npeople say this is one of the best parts \nof a road trip \namazing it has snacks and candy too \ncan I buy some that \n[Music] \nvery well but we have to do your gas \nstation homework okay \nokay thank you Dad \nthey look so colorful can I walk around \nplease \nyes of course \none of the best things about a gas \nstation is that it's integrated with a \nconvenience store \nyou can see a lot of food beverages or \neven lottery tickets here \n[Music] \nwow so what are these dad \nah they are motor oil and auto parts \nwhat is motor oil used for \nit helps our cars run smoothly \nhow about the auto parts dad are they \ncomponents of a car \nyou got it \nthose components can help you repair \nsome parts

your car tires might \nsoon have a blowout they can also check \nthe tire pressure for you \nI didn't know there were so many \nservices at the gas station \nnow you got it \nall right before we leave the station \ncan you tell me what's the difference \nbetween self-service and full service \nI think self-service means we can refill \nthe gas by ourselves \nbut for the full service an attendant \nwill help us \ngood job \nnow let's go home and review what you've \nlearned \nHomework \nare you ready to finish your gas station \nhomework \nI'm all set dad \nin exercise number one you have to
