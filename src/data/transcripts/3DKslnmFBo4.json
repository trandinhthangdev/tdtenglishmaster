I don't want to do a presentation. \nDo we have to do this? \nWell, Somi, it's to improve your English, silly. \nWho's silly? What do you mean? \nAre you saying my English is bad? \nOh come on, Somi. Calm down. \nThat's not what I mean. \nI mean... your English is..., a work in progress. \nWell, at least I'm trying!!! \nUnlike you, Mr. \"I-don't-care-about-anything\"! \nOh, touch\u00e9, Somi. \nBut, hey, don't worry. \nWith a lot more practice, you'll be speaking English like a pro. \nHuh! Just wait until I become \u2026good and show you! \nI can't wait, Somi. \nIt's been 10 minutes, is everyone ready? \nReady. \nThat's great. \nSo please Nam come up and speak first. \nSure, no problem Ms. Jessica. \nWell, everyone, I want to talk\nabout my journey to America to study. \nIt was an exciting adventure. \nI worked hard and got a \u2026 scholarship to become an exchange student here. \nBut my house was not in good condition, \nso I needed to find a way to support myself. \nI got a job as a waiter. \nIt was not easy, but I made some great friends \nand met good people who helped me along the way\u2026 \nIn the end, I want to say that if you try\nyour best, everything will get better. \nThank you, Nam, for sharing your inspiring story. \nI believe things will get better and better. \nAlright, who's next? \nHow about you Somi? \nFine. I will go next. \nAlright, Somi. Please proceed. \nUhh... So..., life in America is not good, people are so hateful. \nSorry to interrupt. \nBefore you continue, could you please speak a bit louder? \nSome students at the back\nmight have trouble hearing you. \nOh.. okay. Is this loud enough, Emily? \nYes. That's better. \nThank you. Somi. Please go ahead. \nSo, life in America ...is not good. Even boring, if you ask. \nWhen I ...came here, I don't understand... a word people... say. \nEnglish... is just ...not my ...thing. \nHey, Somi. \nLooks like you're having a hard time with English. \nOh, cut it off, Flavio. Like you're any better. \nLet's remember to be respectful, everyone. \nOkay, let's continue Somi. \nI'm sorry, Miss Jessica. I'm finish. \nThank you, Somi, for your perspective. \nLet's keep going. \nWho's up next? \nThat's great. So please Flavio come up. \nHey, everyone. \nI'm sure you all already know who I am,\nso I won't waste time introducing myself. \nUnlike some \"boring\" people\u2026my life in America is pretty interesting. \nAs an Italian, I love cooking and\nhave a dream of opening my own restaurant. \nA large restaurant with many delicious\ndishes and great service. \nLuckily, I found a small city in this country \nthat loves different ...types of food from all over the world. \nI go to events, \nshows, and meetings to show off my cooking\nskills and connect with others. \nThat's pretty much it, ...but I've been having a great time so far. \nFlavio, your passion for cooking is amazing. \nI hope to taste your food someday. \nThank you for sharing. \nWho's next? \nMaxim, it's your turn! \nYou can do it. \nOk. \nWow, that's great. Please start Maxim. \nI came to America to find people, not for fun. \nLearning English helps me do that more easily. \nWho are you looking for, a wife? \nI think that's a bit personal. \nIf you don't want to answer, just keep going, Maxim \nAmerica is huge, and I have gone to many places. \nTried many ways to find her \nBut nothing\u2026 \nAll right, thank you Maxim. \nI hope you will find the person you are looking for. \nWho's next? \nI guess it's my turn now, \nGreat, it's time for Gyaan to talk about his experiences abroad. \nGyaan, please come up and share your stories. \nWell, unlike others talking about America. \nI have a funny story from Thailand. \nLet me tell you guys. \nMaxim seems really down. \nI can't help but wonder who he's looking for. \nIt must be someone\nincredibly important to him. \nCould it be the person he loves? \nOne day, a pretty girl came up to me and started talking. \nWe got along and she asked for my number. \nOf course I agree and gave it to her. \nWe texted for days and decided to go on a date. \nOh, a romantic story. \nWell, Flavio, it gets even funnier. \nWhen we met for our date. \nI found out she was actually a boy. \nHow did things go after that? \nI never see him again. \nWow, that's quite a surprise! \nAny other\u2026 si\u2026 si...tua \nSituations \nAny other situations happens. \nOh, definitely! \nOnce, I tried some street food that looked delicious. \nbut it was extremely spicy. \nMy mouth felt like it was on fire, it really is so so hot. \nEveryone around me laughed so hard. \nIt was a memorable moment. \nAnd now I'm more careful with spicy food. \nIt sounds like you had some amusing adventures, Gyaan. \nDid you face any language or cultural differences in Thailand? \nYes, Ms. Jessica. But the people... were kind and ...patient with me. \nWe use body language\nto understand each other. \nIt was a good time there. \nThat's great, Gyaan. \nThank you for sharing your unique experiences with us. \nThank you everyone for great presentations. \nEach of you has your own story and worries, \nbut I believe that things will get better. \nI'm so proud of you all. \nKeep up the good work. \nThank you Ms. Jessica. You too \nThanks Gyaan. Now everyone can take a break. \nHey Flavio, wanna hear a joke? \nOkay. Which one? Tell me. \nI'll say \"Knock knock\" and then you will have to answer \"Who there's?\" \nHmm, okay. Let me see what you got. \nReady? Knock, knock. \nWho's there? \nCow says. \nCow says who? \nno. Cow say mooooooooooooooo! \nDude. \nThat was quite a joke. \nOf course. Want to hear more? \nYup. Dude, you have to tease me with these knock knock joke. \nNo problem. \nHear me and you will understand. \nKnock, knock. \nWho's there? \nAtch. \nAtch...who? \nBless you. \nLet me surprise you with the last one. \nGreat. I'm all ears. \nKnock, knock. \nWho's there? \nHoneydew. \nHoneydew who? \nHoneydew(honey do) you know how much I miss you? \nWant to hear mine? \nKnock knock! \nWho's there? \nDishes. \nDishes who? \nDishes (this is) a very bad joke! \nYou understood the joke. \nGood job. See you. \nGood morning class. \nGood morning, Ms. Jessica. \nAs you know, I have a seminar to attend today. \nSo today, instead of a regular lesson, \nwe are going to have a practical communication. \nWhat does it mean, miss Jessica? \nIt means that instead of learning\nfrom textbooks and doing exercises, \nwe will practice talking and using English\nin real life situations. \nEmily will help me explain the details. \nI have to go now. Goodbye, class. \nHave a good day. \nOkay, class. \nSo we are going to divide into groups\nof two for this activity. \nEach group will have different locations to visit \nand practice your communication skills. \nOh, how to divide the group. \nGood question Gyaan. \nTo make it interesting, we will randomly\ndraw locations and partners. \nRandom draw. \nThat's right. \nIf two people pick the same location,\nthey become a group. \nOkay, let's draw lots! \nRandom Draw? \nI hope I get to be in the same group with Somi. \nI got the clothing store. \nWho else got it? \nHello? \nWho got the clothing store? \nMe. I got the clothing store, too. \nLooks like we're going on a shopping spree together today! \nAlright, Gyaan and Nam, you both picked the clothing store. \nYou're a group! \nWho else has the same location? \nI got the restaurant. \nThat sounds good. \nI also got \"the restaurant\". \nLooks like we are partners, Somi. \nWhat? \nCan I change the group? \nI don't want to be the same group with him. \nWhy not Somi? \nWe will be a great team. \nI DOUBT THAT! \nSomi, the result has been decided and will not change \nSo Somi and Flavio, you are a group. \nGreat. \nNow I'm stuck with \"Mr. I don't care anything\" at the restaurant. \nCome on, Somi, we will have a good time. \nWell Maxim, it seems you are the last one left. \nWhere are you headed? \nTo the supermarket. \nOkay, Maxim, you are with me! \nWe are going to the supermarket. \nOkay. \nAlright, everyone, head to your assigned locations and remember to focus on communication. \nHi there, how can I help you? \nGet me a \"cab,\" please. \nGet a cab? \nThere are no cabs here, sir. \nWhy? Here is the clothing store. \nWhy don't have it? \nYes, here is the clothing store, only clothes. \nYou can go to that corner to get a cab. \nNo, no! Cap for my head. \nOh, you mean a hat? \nSure. We have hats over there. \nThis \"shark\" looks great. \nI don't know if it's expensive or not. \nYou can ask the seller. \nExcuse me. \nExcuse me, how much does \"shark\" cost? \nShark? We don't sell sharks here. \nNo, no! I mean this \"shark.\" \nOh, shirt! My apologies. That one is $20. \nHaha, \"shark\" and \"cap\" mix-up! \nYes, yes! We need more English practice. \nSorry for our bad English. \nWe're practicing to make it better. \nThat's ok! Practice make perfect! \nExcuse me, I want to find \"leh-mohn.\" \nLeh-mohn? Do you speak French? \nSorry I don't understand. \nLeh-mohn. Where is the \"Leh-mohn.\"? \nSorry, I don't get it. \nHe means lemon. \nOh, lemon! Over there in aisle five. \nThank you. \nAisle five? What does it mean? \nAn aisle is like a walking path in a store where you find things to buy. \nLook! That is an aisle. \nIt's the space between shelves where you can walk and choose what you want to purchase, \nlike food or other items. \nOh, I get it now. \nThank you for explaining. \nDo you want to buy anything else? \nYes, maybe some sugar \nSure, let's go. \nExcuse me, I want to find \"shoog-er.\" \nShoog-er? What's that? \nYou don't know \"Shoog-er\"? It's sweet and white. \nIt's \"sugar.\" \nAh, sugar! Aisle two. \nOh! Thank you. \nIs my pronunciation that bad? \nWhy no one understand? \nIt's just not very standard. \nThat's why we need to practice more. \nYou are right. Thank you. \nDon't worry, your English will improve. \nYou're welcome. Let's go. \nI think it's over there. \nWe just go by it. \nAre you okay, Emily? \nAh... yes... Thank you. I'm okay. \nHi, welcome! What can I get for you both? \nLady first \nPlease get me a \"bor-gur.\" \nBurger? \nYes, a burger. \nLike this picture? \nOh, you mean a burger! Sure thing. \nAnything else? \nAnd one fry? \nFry? \nWhat do you mean? \nI think she wants to order French fries. \nOh. No problem. \nWhat size would you like? \nJust small. \nAnd what would you like for dessert? \nI want \"kee-sh.\" \nKee-sh? Hmm, sorry, but I'm not sure what that is. \nShe means cake. \nOh, cake. My bad. \n.... And I want \"to piss\", please. \nHahaha! \nUhm.... You... \nHey... Why you laughing? \nShe wants two pieces of cake. \nOh, sure. Anything else? \nI want spaghetti, that's all. \nHey... That's what I said? Why... \nSomi, you said, \"I want to piss.\" \nWhich mean go to the bathroom. \nSomi, your English is a comedy show. \nWhatever, Flavio. You're just annoying. \nI'm not used to this kind of food. \nI prefer fine dining restaurants. \nfast food has its own charm. \nConsider it a new experience. \nExperience? It's just greasy food and uncomfortable seats. \nWell, not everyone can handle the sophistication of a cheeseburger. \nAre you implying I can't handle simple food? \nI do.... \nShhhh! \n...Hey, what's going on? Why are we running? \nJust run... Don't ask. \nDon't ask. \nFollow me. \nThey're gone. \nThank you. \nWe can go now. \nAh, yes. Let's go! \nAren't you going to ask me why? \nIf you want to tell me, you will. \nIf not, asking won't make a difference. \nThanks. \nWhat happened to Somi? \nWhy were those people chasing her? \nThe mystery remains unsolved. \nBut that day, in the small alley. \nSomething quietly changed. \n"
