    "transcript": "[Music] \nwake up \nhi georges you look sleepy \ni didn't sleep enough flora \nwhat happened did you get up early this \nmorning \nnot really last night my friends asked \nme \nto go out and have beers \ni was actually quite happy this morning \ni had no hangover \nwhat about you well i actually woke up \nthis morning quite \nearly i couldn't sleep so i was a little \nannoyed \nwhat time did you get up i guess around \neight o'clock that's not early \ni was thinking it would be around five \nor six am \nthat is really early for me i went to \nbed at three o'clock \ni thought you were an early bird \nyou are wrong i'm a night owl for sure \nso i usually don't go to bed until about \nthree am \ni find it difficult to go to sleep early \ndon't you have to go to work i am on my \nsummer holiday now \nif i have class from the first period \nevery day \nso i will have to get up about 7 \n30 or 8 am so i will probably sleep \nearlier \nit is really challenging for me you know \ni tried to go to bed early 10 o'clock \n11 30 before midnight \nand i try to get up early 6 30 \n7 before 8 but it doesn't always work \nwhat about you what time do you often go \nto bed \nwell i usually wake up maybe six or \nseven \nin the morning but i don't get up \nstraight away \ni stay in bed for a while maybe read a \nbook or something \ncheck my phone messages and i get up at \nmaybe 7 \n30 8 o'clock \non the weekend i often get up at 6 \no'clock to go to the park with my father \nwe go jogging together \nyou are having a very healthy life \nwhat about during the holiday \n[Music] \nif it's a day off i get up at 9 or 10 \nand in the evening i usually go to bed \naround 10 \n11 sometimes 12. \ndo you need an alarm clock to wake you \nup or you just wake up naturally every \nday \ni actually have this kind of special \nmental ability \ni feel it a bit weird i thought that \neverybody can do this but i found out \nit's not the case \nbut i can wake up exactly the minute i \nwant \nanytime that's amazing \neven though i wake up kinda easily \ni can't wake up at a routine time \nso i usually set the alarm on my phone \nand about \ntwo alarm clocks as well that will \nusually get me up \nso like if i have to get up at 6 14 \nbefore i go to bed i can say okay get up \nat 6 \n14 and i'll wake up at exactly 6 14. \nhow do you do that tell me please \nyeah i don't know how i guess your brain \ncan \njust keep time \nwhen i tell people this sometimes they \nthink \noh come on that's not true \nbut really ever since i was a kid i \ncould just tell myself what time i want \nto wake up \nand i'll wake up exactly at that time \nthat's really quite amazing i wish it \nwas that way for me \nbut it's not yeah \nyou know what's weird because i don't \nuse alarm clocks \nwhat do you mean i can't \nlike an alarm clock the idea actually i \ncan't have a deep sleep if i know that \nit's going to ring and wake me up \nan alarm clock is like somebody pouring \ncold water on you you know \nyeah i'm always paranoid about being \nlate so that's why i set three just in \ncase one doesn't go off \nbut i can sleep any time of the day \nwow that's like you do you like sleep \nlike it really doesn't matter what \noccasion or type of day it's very easy \nfor me to fall asleep \nfor as long as whenever \nso that's why i need to have many things \nto wake me up because i could sleep 12 \nor 14 hours and not wake up \nso do you take naps usually an hour \ni find out if i go over an hour then \nthat's the danger zone \nbecause then if you sleep like two or \nthree hours \nyou wake up and you're just groggy for \nthe whole day \nand if i sleep a lot during noon when i \nwake up i usually have headaches \nso now i am trying not to take naps \nlike can you sleep with the light on \nyes i can sleep in any situation light \nnoise standing sitting up \nnever matters to me i can still sleep \nso you're definitely a deep sleeper i'm \nso jealous of that \nlike just a tiny bit of noise or a \nlittle bit of light and i can't sleep \nand actually i probably only get an \naverage of five hours a night but \ni do sometimes take naps \nyeah not for two i mean i can't sleep \nforever but like seven o'clock eight \no'clock \nthen my body naturally wakes up \nthe flat i lived at before was \nincredibly crazy \nbecause there was a rooster outside and \nit didn't \ndo what it was supposed to do like \nnormal when the sun comes up \nthe rooster is supposed to go or \nwhatever \nbut this thing did it at like one and \ntwo in the morning it used to drive me \nnuts so i used to always wake up at two \nbecause i'd hear this rooster going \nand i just wanted to kill that bird \ndid you go back to sleep after that \nyeah of course i went back to sleep but \nthe bird would wake me up regularly \nyeah no roosters here \n[Music] \nthanks for watching don't forget to like \nshare comment on my video please \nsubscribe to learn english with jessica
