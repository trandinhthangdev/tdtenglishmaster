\nfor so long i forgot that feeling \nyou won't want to get back \nyep \nbut how does your day go \nwell i start a normal morning by working \nup at 7 00 am \nwashing my face brushing my teeth \nhaving breakfast at home \nand going to work at 8 am \nyeah a typical morning right \nyes simple one \nyou prefer to have breakfast at home \ndon't you \nyes but sometimes when i'm in a hurry i \nwill buy breakfast on the way to work \nyeah and then \nwork finishes at 5 pm \ni leave work and go to the supermarket \nto buy food for dinner \nwow \nthen cook wash dishes have a shower \ndoes it eat up all your free time in the \nevening \nno \nactually my free time is from 8 to 10 30 \npm \nwhat do you do during those 2 hours and \na half \nit depends on my mood but normally i \nwatch movies and listen to music \nand not normal \ni learned something new \nwow you deserve respect \nwhy not for example \nlearn how to sing draw \nlots of different interesting things to \nlearn \n[Music] \nyou're right but to be honest whenever \nsomeone mentions learning or studying i \nfeel tired \nyeah i can imagine \ndo you go to sleep at 10 30 pm \nyes \nbut like 15 minutes before sleep time i \nusually read a book \n[Music] \nhow do you feel about that life routine \nsometimes i feel a bit boring but i'm \nalso feeling thankful because i still \nhave time for myself \nyou're right \nenjoy this precious time \nyou may not have much free time when you \nget married and have kids \noh man that future is still too far for \nme \n[Music] \ni know i just mean enjoy the moment \nthanks \n[Music] \nwhat do you do when you have too much \nfree time \n[Music] \nhi i'm hannah \nthank you for coming to our podcast \ntoday \nhi hannah it's so nice to be here today \nbefore we start our podcast i want to \nintroduce our guest today skyler howell \nskyler can you introduce a bit about \nyourself \nhi i'm skyler \ni'm working as a freelancer and have \nachieved some great success with my work \nmaking nearly four hundred thousand last \nyear \nthat's very impressive though \nhowever today we won't go deep about \nyour success story \nbut we want to talk about your time \nmanagement \nokay interesting \ni've heard many successful freelancers \nsay that they have the same problem \nwhich is that they overwork and mess up \ntheir timetable and health \n[Applause] \noh yeah \ni guess as a freelance sooner or later \nyou will have to face that issue \nso how about you \ni used to have that period when \neverything was overwhelming and it \naffected my health a lot \nhow about now \nnow i never work more than 30 hours a \nweek and i have a lot of free time for \nmyself \nand still generating income \nyes definitely by building a system and \nhaving people work for you as you \nmentioned you have a lot of free time do \nyou feel boring \nof course not \nif you know how to fill up your free \ntime in the right way \nhow do you do that \nfirst pick up a hobby or skill that you \nwant to invest a lot of your time into \nhobby or skill \nyes for example \neven when my work contains a lot of \nwriting i still write a lot in my free \ntime \nwhy because i love writing and it \ndoesn't feel like i'm working \nand you see what i write down can \neventually benefit me one day \nyeah do you have any other hobbies \nyes i enjoy gardening oh well that's a \ngreat hobby \nyes now i have a small garden full of \nflowers and trees it's beautiful \nokay \nany other way to fill up your free time \ncooking i have a lot of time to cook so \nwhy would i not make myself delicious \nmeals right \ni have to admit that spending hours in \nthe kitchen making something nice is \nvery satisfying \nyeah also i'm a fan of video games you \nknow do anything as long as it makes you \nhappy \nyeah \nhow about youtube and netflix \ni mean yeah if you love watching things \non those platforms that's fine don't you \nlike it \nno \ni'm not a fan because it's really \nwasting time if you have no control of \nyourself \nyeah true \nis there anything else you want to share \nwith us today \nyes the final one is having too much \nfree time isn't really a bad thing \nenjoy it while it lasts and make use of \nit in a way that makes you feel happy \nthanks a lot for joining us today \nwe really appreciate it \n[Music] \nhow much leisure time do you give \nyourself per day \n[Music] \nwhat are you thinking about joe \nuh nothing i'm just trying to replan my \nlife \nso \nhow's it going \nuh not that great basically i'm trying \nto fix my daily routine \nwhat's wrong with it now \ni'm not very productive \n[Music] \nokay \nyou're trying to make a daily schedule \nor what \nno i'm thinking about how much leisure \ntime i should give myself per day \nhave you figured it out \nnot yet \nsomething is not right so i'm kind of \nconfused \nto me saying \noh i have two free time hours what \nshould i do today to fit that two hour \nis so weird \nyeah true \nso \nany suggestions \ni think you overthink a bit \nfor me leisure time can be anytime i \nfeel relaxed like having coffee before \nwork in the morning \nyes \nbut i want to be a bit stricter to \nmyself you know \nin that case you should schedule a day \ndepending on what the priorities of that \nday are \npriorities \nyes \nthen finish them the time left is your \nfree time easy \nsounds nice though \nright it's a flexible plan as well \nbecause some days when i need my work \ndone i can have no free time \nand some days you can just lay down \nchilling for like five hours right \nexactly \nbecause the goal is being productive \nright \nas long as you finish what you need to \ndo you can relax for the rest of the day \nwow \nthanks a lot mary super nice idea you \nhave and really reasonable \nnot at all i'm just saying from my \npersonal experience \n[Music] \nthanks for watching \ndon't forget to like share \ncomment on my video \nplease subscribe to learn english with
