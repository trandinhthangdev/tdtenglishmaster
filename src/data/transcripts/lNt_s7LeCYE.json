    "transcript": "[Music] \nhello everyone I'm Jessica and welcome \nto learning English with \nJessica in this video we're going to \nlisten and practice our English through \nmany different \nconversations you can play it again \nrepeatedly while engaging in other \nactivities to help your brain memorize \nthe \nlanguage be patient and you will swiftly \nimprove your speaking and listening \nskills \nnow let's jump right into the \nvideo topic common English \nmistakes have you ever made English \nmistakes that made others misunderstand \nwhat you wanted to say some might lead \nyou to awkward \nsituations in today's video I will show \nyou some more common mistakes that \nbeginners often \nmake let's watch the whole video and \nnever make these mistakes \n[Music] \nDave guess what I found an awesome game \nthat we can play together \ntonight what's \nthat it's Guilty Gear strive a fighting \ngame sounds fun but maybe \ntomorrow oh are you busy \ntonight yeah I'll take my girlfriend out \nfor \ndinner okay tomorrow \nthen what's your plan for \ndinner no worries Dave I'll cook \nmyself you \nwhat hold on Tom I see a little mistake \nthere when you say I'll cook \nmyself it means you to cook your own \nbody which I'm sure you don't want to \ndo to express that you want to prepare \nthe meal on your own you could \nsay I'll cook for \nmyself or I'll prepare that meal \nmyself this means you will handle the \ncooking without any assistance from \nothers I get it now thanks \nJessica oh goodness I definitely didn't \nmean to cook \nmyself I mean I'll cook for \nmyself don't worry Tom English can be \ntricky \nsometimes yeah I also want to try the \nnew lasagna recipe I've just \nlearned wow that sounds good \nTom I want to impress everyone with my \ncooking \nskills I'm sure you'll do \ngreat I'll follow the recipe step by \nstep take your time and enjoy the \nprocess do you want to try it I want \nyour opinion as \nwell \nsure you can leave me some in the fridge \nI'll try it \nlater nah I'll make a new dish for you \ntomorrow and that's even better thanks \nin advance \n[Music] \nhi Diana how's it \ngoing hi Tom I'm good thanks how about \nyou I'm doing well too \nthanks I'm pretty excited \nactually oh really what's \ngood I'm on my way to see my cousin my \ncousin is having three \ncats she is having three \ncats yes I'm so excited to see \nthem how can that be \nreal Don't Panic Diana Tom made a \nmistake \nhere the sentence my cousin is having \nthree cats literally means my cousin is \ngiving birth to three cats \nlike we usually say she's having a baby \nor she's having a \nboy if you would like to say that your \ncousin owns three cats it would be \nbetter to use the verb has \ninstead the correct sentence is my \ncousin has three \ncats oh wait my bad it shouldn't be my \ncousin has three \ncats no problem Tom it's easy to make \nsuch \nmistakes but I'm curious about your \ncousin's cats tell me more about \nthem sure my cousin has just adopted \nthree \ncats they're quite naughty but they are \nso cute my cousin loves them \nall how lovely it's nice to see how \npeople cherish their \npets I'm a bit more of a dog person but \nstill cats can be adorable \ntoo definitely each pet has its own \nunique \n[Music] \ncharm Anna it's the fruit counter would \nyou like to buy \nsome of course \nTom do you like \nfruits yes I I do I like apples bananas \nand \noranges how about \nyou I like them too but I eat fewer \nfruit \nnow fewer \nfruit actually \nTom number one fewer is used when you're \ntalking about countable nouns like \napples for example fewer apples fewer \nbananas \nnumber two andless is used for \nuncountable nouns like water sugar th \nfor example less time less \nFreedom you can't count fruit so you \nshould say I eat less fruit \nnow I understand \nJessica I mean I eat less fruit \nnow so why are you eating less \nfruit I want to eat more vegetables and \nmeat instead trying to balance them \nactually that's a great idea vegetables \nare good for you too what's your \nfavorite \nvegetable I really like broccoli it's \ndelicious and \nnutritious I agree broccoli is a good \nchoice I enjoy carrots and \nspinach those are great options too I'll \ntry to eat more of \nthose that's wonderful Tom a balanced \ndiet is essential for staying \nhealthy I will keep that in \n[Music] \nmind hi Bella how are you doing \ntoday hi Tom I'm doing well thank you \nwhat do you want to do today I'm feeling \nso \nboring Tom I think you mean you're \nfeeling bored not \nboring boring describes something or \nsomeone that causes others to feel \nuninterested for example a boring \nmovie but bored describes a feeling how \nyou feel when you have nothing to do it \nis the emotion that someone experiences \nwhen they are not interested or lacking \nengagement for example she looks \nbored so you should say I'm feeling so \nbored I'm feeling bored because I have \nnothing to do right \nnow no problem Tom when I feel bored I \nlike to read a book or watch a movie \nmaybe you could try that too \nthat's a good idea I'll find a book or a \nmovie to keep me \nentertained great what kind of books or \nmovies do you \nlike I like adventure and mystery books \nand for movies I enjoy action and \ncomedy those are fun \nchoices I'm into fantasy books and I \nalso like romantic \ncomedies maybe we in swap books and \nrecommend movies to each \nother great \n[Music] \nidea I'm so busy these days I really \nwant to \ntravel yeah me \ntoo have you ever been
