\nplease lead the way okay so this is the living room it is \nvery spacious you can fit even two sofas in here \nyou will be able to host many gatherings in this space it is beautiful \nmay i see the kitchen and dining area as well i usually spend a lot of time there as i \nlove to cook for my family and friends of course the kitchen is actually my favorite \nfeature of this apartment its design is really modern and caters \nto its owners every need there is a fridge an electric stove \nan oven and even a dishwasher those are really useful indeed i \nespecially love the kitchen island in the middle so trendy \ni see you have good taste come this way please the bedrooms and bathrooms are even more amazing \nhow many bedrooms and bathrooms are in this apartment again this is a two-bedroom apartment with an \nensuite bathroom and a separate one at the end of this hallway \nthat might be too many for me i might have to find someone to share the apartment with \nthat wouldn't be a problem ma'am we do allow sharing also if you decide to start a family \nthis would be an ideal place i agree i really love what i see so far but i'll \nhave to think about it carefully this is the first time i'm living on my own i want everything to be perfect \ni understand should we head back to the agency so we can talk some more about the details \nyes good idea \ndialogue three sam loves the apartment she saw she decides to take another step by \ndiscussing money matters with mark so sam what do you think \ni think the apartment is absolutely lovely i would like to talk about money how \nmuch would the rent cost here it is a thousand dollars a month electricity and internet not included \nnot included isn't that a bit expensive would eight hundred dollars be \nsufficient i'm sorry that price is too low for an apartment that size \nwe can give you other options if you want i really like that apartment though \nwhat about nine hundred dollars that's all i can afford right now \n900 is lower than what we want but we will make an exception for you \nthank you so much i would be really sad if i couldn't rent this place it is an absolute gem \nyes we have had multiple inquiries about it so far but since you called first it is natural \nthat you get to decide first i feel so lucky \ncan you send me the contract later of course i will send it to you as soon \nas possible it was lovely doing business with you same for me thank you again \nmark [Music] \ndialogue for sam received the contract through email after reading it she still wonders about \na few things

in the house like a few dirty spots on the wall or the broken lamp in the bathroom \nare those going to be fixed of course our team will send someone there to make sure everything is \nspotless before you arrive nice what about pets am i allowed to own one \nif yes which ones that's okay but you will have to pay a small fee of 20 a \nmonth and we only allow cats and dogs i see \ndo you know if there is any place for them to play around the apartment there's a park opposite it no worries \nthat's good to hear thank you for your help my pleasure ma'am \ncan i help you with anything else actually yes is there a train station or \na bus stop nearby i don't have my own car yet there is a bus stop right beside the \nbuilding you can also travel by train but i believe the nearest train

\n[Music] \nin the makeup store every girl loves makeup \ntina also she went to a beauty store to buy her first makeup kit \nwatch the video to learn vocabularies about beauty and cosmetics topic \n[Music] \nhello may i help you are you looking for something hi i'm looking for a full basic makeup \nset this is my first time buying those things so i don't know what exactly i need \napart from lipsticks and powder no worries let me help you \nwe can find a lipstick for you first then maybe i will tell you a bit about the steps to apply makeup \nthen we can choose the products according to those steps for you okay thanks a lot i'm still not too sure \nabout all these i'm glad you help my pleasure \nlet me see you seem to have a light skin tone so those lipsticks with bright and deep \ncolors will fit you perfectly normally i use pink lipsticks so i want \nto try some new colors let's try this one then maybelline lipstick shade 382 red for me \nit has a moderately cool toned medium dark red with a matte finish \nthis one looks gorgeous i like it this kind of matte lipstick will stay \nlonger however your lips will feel a bit dry so don't forget to soften your lips with \nlip balm like 10 minutes before applying the lipstick okay i will get this one any other \nrecommendations let me put it in this basket for you \nhow about orange l'oreal brand shade orange avenue 146 satin finish \nit looks somehow wetter and softer but cannot stay as long as a matte finish \nwow i love it very comfortable and smooth oh by the way i also need a lip balm can \nyou recommend one our customers really love this burt's bees lip balm pomegranate flavor \nsmells good i'll take these two also i think that's enough for lips \nokay so let's get over to the face part is that okay sure this is the part i have no idea \nabout [Music] after using moisturizer and sunscreen to \nprotect your skin the first step is preparing your face with primer \nusing primer under your makeup makes your look last longer do you know your skin type \ni'm not sure but i usually have a bit of oil around my nose and forehead but \nother parts are normal i think you have a combination skin type \nfor this type of skin i recommend nyx marshmallow primer our best seller the \nlast month how to apply primer can i use my fingers \nyes you pump out a bit of primer on the back of your hand mix it with your finger and dab it all over your face \nthen gently rub it in okay i got it \ni think your face doesn't have many flaws you don't need concealer so let's move to the foundation \nokay if you say so this is a very important step to have a \nperfect skin look i suggest these two products maybelline fit me or l'oreal true match \nfoundation these light shades will suit your skin tone you can try and tell me which one \nyou prefer [Music] \num let me see i will take this maybelline one i prefer \nthe matte finish it seems to have a better coverage also right \nafter foundation you should apply setting powder this step is optional but if you're looking for long lasting \ncrease free makeup you should use it sure i want one anyway \nwhenever i need a quick makeup look without foundation or reapplying during the day i can use it \nso why not use maybelline fit me powder also great combo for your skin let's \ntake this shade 115 ivory okay \ndo you need contour and a highlighter to make your face slimmer no i think that's too much for me i just \nneed basic kinds of stuff okay so skip those things you will surely need to blush i \nrecommend this l'oreal peach blush powder it has a refreshing peachy color and can \nbe easily matched with many makeup tones this one is our signature blush recently \nvery lovely i will take it i guess those are enough for your facial \nmakeup now let's move to the eye part [Music] \nwow it seems a lot to me already i know i know i had the same feeling \nwhen i bought my first makeup kit so you will need eyebrows eyeshadow eyeliner and mascara \nokay please help me choose something easy to use i'm really not good at this \nsure then use pencil type for eyebrows and eyeliner your hair is light brown so let's take \nthese chocolate eyebrows and eyeliner pencils from nyx try this on your hand to see \nthat's great really fits my hair color give me these two \nokay for mascara trust me you will love this maybelline one we have received really good reviews \nfrom customers for it sure then take this one \nokay finally you need eye shadow do you like any of these this palette looks so gorgeous \nright but that palette has kind of two bright colors for you in my opinion \nit will be difficult for you to mix with daily makeup tones because this is your first one i suggest \nyou should try a neutral tone how about this one same brand and product line from \nrevolution let me see it has 24 shades that give you \neverything you need for your look from light shimmers warm browns rich golds rusty oranges and dark smoky \nshades this one looks great as well let me take this then \nokay i think that's all you need oh have you had makeup brushes yet \nno thanks for reminding me i need those two there are so many types of brushes what \ntype do i need real techniques everyday essentials set is all you need this one has four \nbrushes with a sponge you can find the instructions to use those brushes on the back of the \npackaging but basically it is enough for you to apply foundation to eyeshadow \nthanks a lot for your help i can't imagine how long i will spend here without your help there are too many \nproducts to choose from you're welcome it's my pleasure to help you \nhere is your basket with all those products thank you i will go to the checkout counter now \nhave a nice day thanks you have a nice one
