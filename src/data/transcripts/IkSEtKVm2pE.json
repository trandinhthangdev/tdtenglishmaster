agree with you but i didn't come up \nwith any ideas anna an idea springs to mind \nmake a cake by ourselves is that fine that's good but we don't know how to \nmake a cake uh search google everything

that fine \nit's up to you i'm free so let's go right now \n[Music] \nhi welcome to mr john's baking class may i help you we need to join a baking \nclass this afternoon where can i apply for the class this way please \ndo you register for a long term course or one day class does your center have a 1-1 class \nbecause we intend to make a cake for my parents wedding anniversary \ncertainly we have that here is the place you can register \nafter completing the procedure you can participate right now \nthank you so much you're welcome \ngood afternoon to girls good afternoon \nso now i'll introduce myself first my name is john beckham \nyou can call me teacher john during the class hello teacher john i'm sophie \nthis is my younger sister anna hi teacher john it's great to study making cake with you \nit's my pleasure so let's get started with cupcakes \nthey are often called in special events like a grand opening party anniversary \nand so on yes i really like it so excited to make it so now let's guess \nwhich ingredients you need anna and sophie for sure we must have flour eggs and vanilla or \nchocolate which depends on the taste of cupcakes what about sophie's idea \nwell actually i just know only three ingredients above that's fine \nwhat kind of flour do we use girls do you know i don't \nneither do i we have to use self-raising flour because you will see that your cakes \nalways rise perfectly and more importantly that you get a consistent rise every time \nwhat ingredients else sophie i don't know \nboth of you forgot the most important things which are milk and butter \noh exactly it completely slipped my mind \nokay so now i'll list all ingredients we need to make this cake \nfirst of all as you mentioned they are eggs self-raising flour and vanilla \nextract we also need milk softened butter icing sugar and golden castor sugar \nteacher john why don't you use refined sugar instead of icing one \nsimply icing sugar dissolves quickly in cold water sometimes people keep it on hand just to \nadd to juices milkshakes and other cold beverages so what is the quantity of all the \nelements teacher john i'll tell you now 110 grams softened butter 110 grams \ngolden caster sugar 2 large eggs a half teaspoon vanilla extract and 110 grams \nself-raising flour that's all for the crust and these are ingredients for butter \ncream 150 grams softened butter 300 grams icing sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla \nextract three tablespoons of milk you can add food coloring if you want \nbut today i'm just going to teach you the traditional cupcake with buttercream on it \nyes i saw those elements on my table and we have to determine them \nabsolutely are you ready [Music] yes we are ready to make cakes \nso let's set to work teacher john do we have to heat the oven \nfirst right that's right at 180 degrees celsius \nand then you fill a 12 cupcake tray with cases i'm done teacher \nokay next use an electric whisk be 110 gram softened butter and 110 grams golden \ncaster sugar together until pale and fluffy \nand then whisk in two large eggs one at a time scraping down the sides of the \nbowl after each addition softened butter teacher i forgot how to \ntake it out of the refrigerator so did i is it possible to use cold \nbutter teacher john no we cannot we must use softened butter for this \ntype of cake why because such butter is capable of \nholding air and the creaming process is then butter traps that air \nwhile baking that trapped air expands from the heat and produces a fluffy baked good \nwow i can gain one more new knowledge about making cakes \nteacher drawn does it have the difference between room temperature and softened butter \nactually no it depends on your room's degree they can be interchangeable \nbut in the recipe we use softened butter right certainly \nwhat do we do next teacher after that add half a teaspoon vanilla \nextract 110 grams self-raising flour and a pinch of salt whisk until just \ncombined then spoon the mixture into the cupcake cases teacher john at this stage can i replace \nhot chocolate instead of vanilla of course as i mentioned above vanilla \nor chocolate depends on your taste even if you want the strawberry taste you can add it \noh thanks teacher [Music] \n[Music] sophie you still want to keep the vanilla taste \nthat's right i prefer vanilla to chocolate okay it's time to bake \noh my gosh i'm really excited about this step i like seeing cupcakes hatching during \nthe baking process yes most bakeries like this step \nokay so bake for 15 minutes until golden brown and a skewer inserted into the \nmiddle of each cake comes out clean leave to cool completely on a wire rack \nexactly 15 minutes teacher john right if cupcakes are over baked they'll \nbe burnt therefore we should set an alarm i got it \nwhile we're waiting for baking we are making buttercream firstly whisk 150 grams softened butter \nuntil super soft then add 300 grams icing sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla extract \nand a pinch of salt \nthe next step is whisking together until smooth then beat in three tablespoons of \nmilk sophie and anna we should start off slowly to avoid the icing sugar cloud \nremember that i got it almost i whisk a mess away \njumping the gun all right we're almost finished \nthe final step 15 minutes is over so let's take those cupcakes out of the oven \nif wanting to color stir the food coloring now spoon or pipe onto the cooled cupcakes \nfancy that their colors are so beautiful so is mine \nand now we will make second cakes guess what red velvet cake or biscuits \nno we don't make biscuits anna because we did a little creamy cake \nwhat you said is a clue for me to guess what next we will make so what \ncelebration cake is that right teacher john totally correct \nso which taste of celebration cake do you like many tastes to choose from teacher john \nwhich taste do you suggest for the wedding anniversary i suggest honey and almond layer cake \nsimple elegant wedding cake or chocolate cake sophie doesn't like chocolate so i \ninclined towards honey and almond layer cake what about you sophie same idea as anna teacher john \nwell we decided to make almond and honey layer cake then yes \nlet's cut to the chase i'll list all ingredients that we need \n280 grams unsalted butter softened \ngrams light muscovado 140 grams clear honey plus two \ntablespoons three medium eggs plus four medium egg yolks \n280 grams plain flour 100 grams ground almonds \n1 teaspoon baking powder 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 125 milliliters of milk \noh really so many that's all the ingredients we need teacher john \nlots of ingredients that's just for the crust and these are for the swiss meringue \nbuttercream 300 grams unsalted butter softened 4 \nmedium egg whites 250 grams golden caster sugar 2 tablespoons of clear \nhoney candied almond is available so we don't have to make it \nits stage takes a lot of time we are all ready teacher john \nthe first step is also the longest step we heat the oven at 180 degrees celsius \nfirst now let's make the honey and almond sponges \ngrease cake tin and line the bases with baking parchment you can use an electric hand mixer to \nbeat the butter muscovado sugar and 140 grams honey until pale and fluffy \nteacher john i know the next step what do you do next \nadd the eggs and yolks one at a time beating after each addition until well incorporated \nthat's correct well done \nafter that whisk together the flour almonds baking powder and a quarter teaspoon of salt \nadd half of the flour mixture to the butter mixture and beat until just combined \nadd the vanilla and milk continuing to beat then add the remaining flour mixture beating until just combined \ni want to cry celebrating cake has many steps \nfight we have almost done the first step \nnext divide the mixture evenly between the tins and bake for 45 to 55 minutes \nor until a skewer inserted into the center of each cake comes out clean \nallow the cakes to cool for 10 minutes in their tins then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely \nleave the oven on for the candied almonds notice the time my students \nwhen do we move to the next step teacher making cakes requires patience and \nmeticulous characteristics i'm not this kind of person \nneither am i even so we just made cupcakes not celebration cakes \nno in spite of being tired i still want to make a celebration cake by myself \ni do too come on girls you can do it the second step is making honey syrup \nput two tablespoons honey and two tablespoons water in a small saucepan \nand heat for one to two minutes or until the honey has dissolved then set it \naside done then make the swiss meringue butter \ncream using an electric hand mixer beat the butter until pale and fluffy \nput the egg whites and sugar in a clean heat proof bowl over a pan of simmering water \nheat the mixture until the sugar has dissolved remove the bowl from the heat and using \nan electric hand mixer whisk for 10 minutes or until the mixture forms stiff peaks and has cold \nto room temperature next add the butter one to two tablespoons at a time \nand beat until the mixture is smooth and creamy beat in the honey and transfer to a \npiping bag filling with a one centimeter nozzle when do we finish teacher john \nmaking this cake takes much more time than i thought almost done girls don't give up only one \nmore step oh my god eventually i almost finished \nthis cake next assembling the cake step is also simple for you \nlevel the sponges by cutting off the domed tops and split each sponge in half to create four layers \nfix the bottom layer to a cake board or stand with a splotch of buttercream brush with the honey syrup and pipe a \nlayer of buttercream on top gently press the second layer on top and \nrepeat with the remaining layers cover the cake with a thin layer of buttercream then use a palette knife to \nscrape the sides clean pipe a ring of buttercream blobs around the top or spread a thick layer with a \npalette knife decorate with candied almonds \nwe finish how pretty the cake is \nyou helped us make two kinds of cake i'm so thankful for you teaching us teacher \njohn thanks a million teacher it's my pleasure and give my love to \nyour parents and tell them happy silver wedding
