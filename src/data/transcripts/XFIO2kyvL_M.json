sort the big stuff first like a bookshelf or a wardrobe \nyes i agree what do you think about the bookshelf \nwhere should i put it i want to save space i guess the best choice is that the \nbookshelf is in the corner the left corner \nover there it's next to the desk it's easy to get books \nis this okay of course i want to put the television on the \nmiddle shelf that's a good idea these shelves have a lot of room for \ndecorations the pictures can be on them cool \nhow about the wardrobe is it okay when it is next to the bookshelf \ni don't think so why don't you put it here the space seems to be for the wardrobe \nwow it fits perfectly in here right \nah i forgot what's that \nthis tree oh wow do you have a tree in your room \nyes this is my grandfather's gift for my last birthday i love that \ni've heard that putting plants in the room helps to freshen the air and make \nthe mood more comfortable did it work definitely yes \ni feel the atmosphere is more fresh so that i can work effectively \nthat sounds amazing i will try it after yes \nand now this tree is in the right corner what do you think \ncool this location is very suitable for your room \nbut these are just ideas i
