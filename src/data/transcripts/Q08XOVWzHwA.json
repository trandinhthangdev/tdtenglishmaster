    "transcript": "[Music] \ntalking about \nmy country \nsituation one anne is a new student \nfrom london and she discusses with her \nnew friend \nemma about the culture in england \nand america \nhi anne welcome to boston high school \ni'm emma i'm your new classmate let me \nshow you around \nthanks emma nice to meet you \n[Music] \nso anne where do you come from \ni'm from london this is the first time \ni've traveled to \namerica wow all the way from england \ni have always wanted to travel there \nliving in a new country is fun and \nexciting but it's going to be a big \nchange for me so i want to know more \nabout this country \ncan you share some common things about \nthe american culture please \nsure the american culture is very \ninteresting \nfirst of all americans often prefer \nlarge and luxurious \nto them large can be practical \ni think thinking big also applies to \namerican food too \nmost restaurants serve very large \nportions \namericans love going out to eat or \nordering takeout \nso if you're going to out to eat and \naren't sure of the size \nit's okay to ask your server what they \nrecommend \nyes because the u.s is a melting pot of \ndifferent cultures \nbringing along a variety of tasty foods \nthat's right even in small american \ntowns \nyou're likely to find pizza chinese \njapanese or mexican food \nin larger cities you'll find restaurants \ndevoted to ethiopian brazilian or \nafghani cuisine \nthat's cool and i can see that many \namericans \nlove and follow sports people say one of \nthe most popular differences between \nbritish and american english \nis how they see the games really \namericans do not like small scores \nthat's why they do not like football \nthey tend to like games with big scores \nlike basketball and american football \n[Applause] \nand the english people tend to be more \npatient in playing and this can be seen \nin many games such as cricket and \nfootball \noh sports can be a huge uniting and \ndividing factor among americans \nduring football and basketball season \nyou might see people getting into \nspirited debates about whose team is \nbetter \nfootball is fun to watch but can be \npretty confusing to follow \ncan you help me out i want to know why \nover a hundred million \namericans watched the 2017 super bowl \nsure no problem what else do you want to \nknow \nwhat is the main religion in america \nback in my hometown people are now \ngetting away from the church and tend to \nbe less religious \nthe united states is remains a \npredominantly \nchristian nation people in the united \nstates tend to be more religious \nespecially those living in the southern \nregions \noh how about the people in america \noften americans tend to be friendly they \ntend to want to be part of someone \nelse's problems as they communicate \nthe english people really appreciate \npersonal privacy \nand they try to give respect without too \nentering the private affairs of others \nthis difference is the reason why the \nenglish tend to be \ncooler \ni guess so and you know that the british \ntend to be elegant in appearance \nright this is the opposite of most \namericans who tend to be casual \ngenes were created first in the united \nstates and we now know \nwhy they were not created in england \ntrue the english people tend to be more \npolite \neven the level of decency the british \npeople have is often viewed as higher \nthan the average of other europeans \nthis tends to contradict the american \nway of communicating \nthey tend to bring out jokes which for \nmost english people are \nquite rough americans also tend to speak \nloudly \nmany consider the united states and the \nunited kingdom \nare two nations divided by the same \nlanguage \nhowever while it is true that both \nnations have historically shared a close \nrelationship \nthey have major differences in culture \ni agree but it's a fact that both of \nthese cultures are interesting \ni want to travel to england to learn all \nabout its culture \nyou can come with me when i go back to \nengland to this summer \nreally that's great thanks \nno
