    "transcript": "Introduction \n[Music] \nmaking \ndinner plans a group of college \nstudents is speaking over the video call \nto discuss dinner meanwhile \na couple is also planning their weekend \ndinners \nwith their new neighbor watch the video \nto see the difference \nbetween the two meals \nPreparations \n[Music] \nso we will all be back at the dorm by \nwednesday afternoon \nright yes \nit's been a while we need to have a big \ndinner i have a lot of things to tell \nyou guys about my winter break \nsame here i kind of miss eating with you \nguys \nwe need to have a proper plan for this i \nthink whoever arrives at the dorm first \nshould start with the preparations what \ndo you mean by preparations \nyou want us to cook an entire dinner by \nourselves \nuh yes that's our daily task \nisn't it normally yes but i assume all \nof us are going to be exhausted \nafter our long flights and hours on the \ntrain \ncamilla is right we won't have enough \nstrength to cook \nbesides we're all coming back a little \nbit early \nthe dorm's kitchen won't be open until \nfriday \nbut we have a microwave in our room \nthere are dishes that we can make with a \nmicrowave \nit's true but then we would have to go \nto the supermarket \ni'm too lazy for that me too \ni think we should just order something \nit's a lot faster \nand more convenient well \nthen let's go with that option what do \nyou guys want to eat \ni heard there's a new burger king open \nnear campus \ncan we order from there it's going to be \ndelivered fast \noh and they also have vegan options for \nnaomi \nsounds delicious but unfortunately i'm \non a diet so i really can't have fast \nfood \nreally what a shame i've been craving \nburgers \nwait i have an idea i think we all have \neaten \na lot during the holiday so why don't we \norder a vegan dinner to balance it down \ni'm not a big fan of vegan food to be \nhonest \nbut i guess i'll give it a try \nyou should don't worry some of them \ntaste exactly like meat \nall right then where should we order \nfrom \ndon't choose places that are too far \nfrom our campus \ncamilla you were the one who suggested \nit do you know any good vegan \nrestaurants around here \n[Music] \ni only know one it's called bliss but i \nhaven't eaten there many times and i can \nproudly say that it's \nthe best great \nbella are you fine with it yes of course \nthen we will wait until all of us arrive \nat the dorm after that we can look at \nthe menu and decide what to order \ntogether \nhow does that sound that's good \ni agree too \n[Music] \nlogan you invited the george family over \nfor dinner this weekend right \nyes is there a problem no \ni just think we should start planning it \ni mean it's friday already \noh you're right okay let's start \nwell for the appetizer what do you want \nto eat \ni like the prawn salad you made last \nweek but there's peanut butter in there \nyou know a lot of people are allergic to \nthat \ni think so too we don't know for sure so \nlet's just go for safer options \nwhat do you think about baked potatoes \nis it too simple \nno problem i'll just add some bacon \ncheese and sour cream \nwe also haven't had potatoes for a while \nthat sounds delicious i'll wait for it \nall right now for the main dish this is \nwhere we have to consider \ncarefully main dishes are always the \nmost important factor of a dinner \nyou're absolutely right i was thinking \nabout \nsteak but i guess it's too basic right \nindeed i'm a chef so the george family \nmust have a little bit of expectation \nwe have to come up with something \nspecial i think you should make some \npasta \npasta that's one of the most common main \ndishes \ni know i mean making the pasta from \nscratch \nnot buying them at the store and then \nboiling them \nit's going to take a while to do that \nbut i've been making them quite a lot \nlately so i think it's fine \nyes making pasta from scratch isn't easy \ni bet they will appreciate the dish a \nlot \nso after i'm done making them can you \ntake care of the rest \nof course creamy chicken and spinach \npasta sounds good right \nthat's amazing great now we're almost \nfinished \ncome up with a decent dessert and then \nit's all done \ndessert is easy they have 10 year old \ndaughter and i think she would love some \nbrownies \ni'll make sure to add some fruit for \nbalance \nare you sure she'll like it oh logan \nevery kid loves chocolate \nthey are usually the pickiest eaters so \nsometimes simple is better \nall right then i'll listen to you that's \nall right \nyes do you mind going to the supermarket \nwith me tomorrow \nwe have to go buy the ingredient of \ncourse i'll drive you there \nthank you \nShopping \nokay so first we need to buy some \npotatoes \ntheir family has three people and there \nare two of us so \nfive potatoes in total yes but i think \nwe should buy some more \ni want to make more potato dishes for \nour future dinners \nright then let's just get a small sap \nthat sounds reasonable do we have any \nsour cream \nyes we still have half a jar that i made \nmyself that should be enough \nbut we have to get some bacon let's go \nto the meat section then \nwe have to buy chicken for the pasta too \n[Music] \noh right you want to use the thigh part \nof the chicken or \nchicken breasts there will be a huge \ndifference between the two \nreally i haven't thought about that yet \nhonestly \nbut i think using chicken breast is \nbetter i think so too \nit suits the pasta better and it's \nhealthier as well but remember to cook \nit \nfor a fairly long time i think their \ndaughter would prefer chicken thighs \nbut if the breast is tender enough i \nthink there would be no problem \nokay noted we only need one tray of \nbacon right \nyes it's more than enough we still have \nsome spinach at home don't we \nactually we ran out of it i checked \nbefore we came \nwell let's go get some and some heavy \ncream for the sauce too \n[Music] \ndo you have all the ingredients for the \npasta alone \nyes they're all ready great \nnow we need to buy some chocolate and \nfruit for your brownies \nhey should we get the one with the 60 \ncocoa or 50 \ncocoa the 50 cocoa \ni want to make it as sweet as possible \nsince it's for the kid \ndone do we need to get any fruit \ni don't think so we have quite a lot at \nhome already \n[Music] \nall right now there's only one thing \nleft drinks \ndo you want red wine or white wine i \nprefer champagne actually \nbut it's okay to change it up once in a \nwhile you can get whatever type of wine \nyou like \nwhat about the kid i'll make some \nlemonade for her \nbut just in case let's go get some soft \ndrinks \n[Music] \nokay do we have everything uh let me \ncheck yes we do let's go to the cashier \n[Music] \nthanks for watching don't forget to like \nshare comment on my video please \nsubscribe to learn english with jessica \nchannel \nto watch
