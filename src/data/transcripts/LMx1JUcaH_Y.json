asked \nabout have you ever wondered why despite \nall your efforts you might still sound a \nbit different from native English \nspeakers well you're not alone when I \ntry to study Korean to understand BT \nsong I got the same problem together \nwe'll explore eight common reasons why \nEnglish Learners struggle to sound like \nnatives by the end of this video video \nyou'll have practical tips to bring your \nEnglish speaking closer to that of a \nnative \nspeaker so grab your notebooks and let's \nDive Right \nIn One banic \nPhonemic Awareness \nawareness imagine you know how to play a \nsong on the piano but one day someone \ngives you a guitar and asks you to play \nthe same song the notes are there but \nthey sound and feel different on the \nguitar just like the piano and the \nguitar are English has some sounds or \nnotes that might be new to you because \nthey don't exist in your \nlanguage these new sounds can be a \nlittle tricky to say at first but with \npractice you can learn to play them just \nright two intonation \nIntonation Patterns \npatterns have you ever been on a roller \ncoaster notice how it goes up and down \ncreating a fun \nride our voice does something similar \nwhen we speak it rises and falls \neach language has its own unique roller \ncoaster \nride sometimes when learning English we \nmight use the ups and downs from our \nlanguage which can sound a bit different \nto native English \nspeakers it's like trying to fit a piece \nfrom one puzzle into another it might \nnot fit perfectly at first but with \npractice you can learn the right \npattern three stress \nStress Patterns \npatterns \nimagine a \ndrum sometimes you tap it softly and \nother times you hit it with more Force \nto create a louder \nsound in English words are like that \ndrum some parts of the word are said \nmore loudly like a strong drum beat \nWhile others are \nsofter for example in the word photo we \nstress the first part but in \nphotographer we stress the second \npart saying me stresses correctly help \nto sound more natural in English Just \nLike Music getting the Rhythm right can \nmake a big \ndifference so remember to give some \nparts of words their special drum beat \nInfluence of First Language \nfour influence of first \nlanguage imagine you're making pizza but \naccidentally use some ingredients from \nSushi like seaweed or raw fish \nit might still taste good but it's not a \ntypical \nPizza our native language is like the \ningredients we know well from our \nfavorite dish when we learn English \nsometimes we might use ingredients or \nways of speaking from our own \nlanguage this can make our English sound \na bit different just like the sushi \nPizza being aware of these extra \ningredients can help us make our English \nsound more like what native speakers are \nused to but remember every language mix \nadds its own unique flavor and that's \nokay five \nExposure \nexposure imagine you are an artist and \nyou want to paint a beautiful picture of \nSunrise but you've never seen a sunrise \nbefore if you haven't seen a real \nSunrise your painting might look very \ndifferent from what it actually looks \nlike if you don't often listen to native \nEnglish speakers it might be challenging \nto understand the exact colors and \nshapes of the \nlanguage to paint your English \nconversations beautifully try to see as \nmany English sunrises as possible listen \nto English songs watch English movies or \neven listen to \npodcasts the more you expose yourself to \nnative English speakers the better your \npainting will \nbe remember every stroke of brush brings \nyou closer to creating a masterpiece in \nVocabulary Usage \nEnglish six vocabulary \n[Music] \nusage imagine a garden in this Garden \nthere are many unique flowers some \ncommon and some very rare speaking \nEnglish is like picking flowers for a \nbouquet native speakers sometimes pick \ncolorful unique flowers these are like \nthe slang idioms or special sayings they \nuse if you only use the common flowers \nor formal words all the time your \nbouquet or conversation might lack some \nvariety it's still beautiful but might \nseem a bit formal for a casual \nchat for example if someone says it's \nraining cats and dogs they mean it's \nraining heavily not that animals are \nfalling falling from the \nsky such phrases add color and fun to \nconversation to sound more natural in \nEnglish try adding a mix of different \nflowers to your language \nbouquet learn a few slang words or \nidioms and you'll fit right into casual \nchats with native \nspeakers seven fear of making \nFear of Making Mistakes \n[Applause] \nmistakes remember when you were a little \nkid at the \nplayground the first time you tried the \nswings the slide or the Seesaw it might \nhave been a bit scary learning English \nis a bit like playing on that playground \nat first you might be afraid to try new \nwords sounds or sentences because you \ndon't want to make mistakes but just \nlike at the playground the only way to \ntruly learn and have fun is to give it a \ntry yes \nsometimes you might slip or stumble but \nthat's okay every mistake is a step \ncloser to getting it \n[Applause] \nright so don't be afraid to play with \nthe language experiment with sounds and \nenjoy The Learning \nJourney remember it's okay to fall off \nthe swing as long as you get back up and \nkeep \nswinging eight physical \nPhysical Aspects \n[Music] \naspect think of learning to speak \nEnglish is going to the gym but for your \nmouth just like our arms and legs have \nmuscles that we train in the gym our \nmouth tongue and lips have muscles too \nand they need training to produce some \nEnglish sounds that might be \nnew in your language you might use \ncertain mouth moves regularly but in \nEnglish there could be new moves or \nsounds it's like trying a new exercise \nfor the first time just as you would \npractice a new exercise to get it right \npracticing English sounds can help train \nyour mouth \nmuscles over time with enough workouts \nyour pronunciation will get stronger and \nclearer so keep exercising those mouth \nmuscles and soon you'll be a iation \nChampion that's the end of the video \nthank you for \nwatching Remember to practice English \nevery day to improve your \nskills watch the video at least three \ntimes a week and repeat daily \nconversations to improve your listening \nand speaking skills \nfast try to mimic the intonation and \npronunciation in the video to enhance \nyour speaking fluency and \npronunciation don't forget to like share \nand comment on my video please subscribe \nto the learn English with Jessica \nchannel to watch more helpful \n[Music] \nvideos \n"
