leave linda here alone \nsure sir i told her we should tell the truth to the boss i feel really bad right now \neverything is broken [Applause] oh my sister \nshe starts saying nonsense i think we should call the doctor \nquickly [Music] \ntravel adam and jean are a couple planning for \ntheir one week getaway at the end of december hey adam \ni think it is about time we start planning on our holidays sure i'm not busy at the moment \ngreat because i have just found an ideal place for our getaway \nit is a seaside resort with luxurious services i got the place from allen he went there \nin the summer and he said it was fantastic staying there \nthe place seems nice but he went there in the summer would the place be as \nany more comfortable in the winter season let me check the location online \ni haven't researched it myself only just heard about it from alan \nwhat is the name of the resort it's the coralina resort \nit is somewhere on the west coast of california \nthere seems to be no room left at the place it's all book really how unfortunate for us \nthe resort is pretty pricey though it would most likely be over budget for us \nabout our budget was it fifteen hundred dollars or twenty five hundred dollars that we have agreed \non it was only fifteen hundred dollars but we can go up to two thousand dollars if \nyou want i have got a raise a month ago remember \nobviously the more the better it will surely give us more flexibility \nit is settled then we can afford a decent trip with two thousand dollars \nbut that will include what we want to bring with us before the trip right \ncertainly but i'm sure it wouldn't take up much we will have to make a rough estimate \nlater after we decided on the list of necessary things i'm having a lot of things in my mind at \nthe moment but i guess i have to wait then take it slow gene or we will go nowhere \nokay now back to choosing the location how about we go somewhere chilly but \nworth visiting in the winter i mean a getaway doesn't mean a week chilling in a resort \nwe can take the time and have a small adventure that sounds really interesting \ni think i can hook us up with a travel agency or some sort better yet a close friend of mine \ndo you remember chris he is the guy who organized my company's field trip it was awesome \ni'm guessing he would be as good this time only he can answer \nhey adam what's up hi chris i need to ask you a few questions \nare you free now i have about 20 minutes before i get back to work so if left you plenty of \ntime nice so are you free late december \naround the two weeks of the year i haven't had anything occupied me \nbesides my annual family reunion oh yeah that's a bumper \nwell gene and i are planning to take a trip somewhere and we're wondering if you can organize something \norganizing one wouldn't be so hard be the tour guide is way harder so have you got anything in mind \nwe were looking to spend our week at a resort but we decided that going on a road trip would be better \ngoing on a road trip in the winter season we have just thought of that moments ago \nwe would prefer a warmer route please but if not a wintry one with great snowy \nscenery would surely make my day most road trips wouldn't last more than \na few days though but i will give you some options along the way give me two days and i will fill you in \nwith the details you can count on me guys thank you very much chris \njust send us the bill nah that's okay no need for that \noh you sure are kind chris we're looking forward to hearing from you soon \ngoodbye guys bye chris he is a great guy isn't he \nsure is now that we got someone to take care of the details let's get on our stuff \nfinally we got to this i'm thinking of getting sunscreen sun shades and more warm clothes \nthe sun still works out in the winter you know and your jackets and sweaters are kind \nof old it's reasonable to me because we are going to need some warmth \nso a tent and some blankets would be neat we could have a rent a car too \nthat would be expensive it would be cheaper than staying in a resort for a week \nshould we bring canned food too yes and we will make a small campfire to \ncook them and perhaps some marshmallows and sweets i'm wholeheartedly agreeing \nsuch experiences should be well worth it flashlights and emergency supplies \na gps device would be very handy and where could we get a stable water \nsource i don't know i'm sure chris will have something for us \nso that's all i can't think of anything else me neither \nthe list is really long already these have taken more than half our budget \ni have just remembered i have a date with the dentist today i got an hour to prepare \nwe will get all these later sometimes in mid-november great i will go do my things \nbye adam bye gene \njane daisy and mary meet in a coffee shop to talking about \njane's upcoming holiday in san francisco the u.s in the next month \nhi daisy hi mary haven't seen you guys for so long \nhi jane we are on time aren't we hi jane mary here tried her best to be on time \ntoday she ran into some troubles outside of her house \nwe managed it well but we better not talk about it okay then how are you guys doing \ni got promoted two months ago with a better salary and perks \nwork is stressful but i'm holding on pretty well lucky you \nyou must have worked so hard for that position it has been a long time since i last \ntaken a serious vacation if you need any advice on that you can count on us \nyeah i can be of great help when it comes to these matters i'm also in need of traveling \nsuggestions daisy this is the reason why i want to meet up with you guys \nwe know so what is hanging in your mind right now \ni'm worried about getting lost in san francisco gps service is no stranger to me \nbut the feeling of being alone in a big city upsets me from time to time \nis there anyone accompanying you well there will be james my brother but \nhe can only be by my side most of the time i want to enjoy the trip when he isn't around \ntake a stroll downtown or chill on the beach you are adventurous aren't ya \nadventurous yet easily disoriented unfortunately that is true \nyou can take a map with you at all times just in case your phone's battery died in the middle of the street \ntourist maps are sold everywhere in popular visiting sites you should find it quite easily \nmap reading isn't really hard you know i hope it wouldn't be very troublesome \nto carry a map everywhere the trade-off is worth it in my view \ni will do it then transportation wouldn't be a big problem though \nbuses and taxis are all over the place do you want to rent a bike i know that \nsan francisco has a lot of facilities and policies which promote bikes \noh i can ride bikes quite smoothly then this is an option you should really \nconsider it's generally cheap and safe too \ni hope there are renting stations near where you are staying and by the way \nwhere are you planning on staying well initially i plan to stay at my \nbrother's house but it would take me two hours of subway and bus rides to get there \nso instead i booked a hotel room with a reasonable price just 20 minutes away \nbut would that require you to get back early only the days that my brother is busy \nand i have to go alone and be aware of the urban area after dark you wouldn't know what danger is \nlurking in the dark i've got some things to defend myself with but yeah i'll be careful \nyou have put some thought into the trip i have been planning this for the last two weeks i'm very excited about the \ntrip it's the first solo trip i have ever taken i have long chosen the places i \nshould visit i would love to go on a holiday in san francisco someday \ndo you want to go with me on this trip i will pass the offer jane \ndeadlines are killing me such a bumper guys \nit's time for me to go i still have work to do to prepare for the trip it has been fun hanging out with you \nguys keep us updated about the trip okay \ni will daisy goodbye jane see you later guys \ncharles and jean have just come home from their vacation in miami they are unpacking things and talking \nabout the trip finally it felt like forever in the car \nhome sweet home let's get some rest now not now charles \nwe need to look through our things remember why do we need to do that again \nand why now and not later if we happen to forget something at the hotel or on the bus we could report it \nsoon enough i'm pretty sure i got all of my important things with me \nyou never know charles i just want to be sure okay then i will do this with you \nlet's start with my stuff i can never remember all of your cosmetics and skin care \ni don't really expect guys to be able to keep track of everything we own even girls like me can forget simple \nnecessities such as lipsticks and i have all seven of mine right here \nso this one is off the list so what's next \ni'm absolutely sure that all of my valuables are in this jewelry box i have triple checked it yesterday and locked \nit so it is out of the way how much did you invest into filling up \nthat box of yours most of them were gifted to me by friends and family \ni only have spent around two hundred dollars which is not much it's quite acceptable actually \nif one of my passions is expensive i'm more than willing to go beyond that \nah i appreciate the understanding we have depleted our supply of face \nmasks so make sure to go get some more later today \ntop of my to-do list my entire makeup box is passed \neverything is in its proper place with no damage whatsoever you were very protective of it \nthis is every girl's treasure chest you know yeah i've acknowledged \ni only have 45 dollars left in my purse we did spend a lot of money on souvenirs \nand local food but they were amazing and i couldn't stop myself \nme neither we can go on and on for days i still have around twenty dollars in my wallet \ni made sure we had some spare bucks for the trip back home oh no i've lost my sunglasses \ndid you wear it on our way home i didn't where could it be \ni have no idea gene i've not seen those sunglasses for two days \nreally i can't even recall the last time i wore it whatever that pair of sunglasses were \ncheap and uncomfortable anyway well that is all there is in my handbag \nlet's proceed to our suitcases i agree let's do mine first \ni'm eager to hand the new dreamcatcher thing i got three days ago on our bedroom wall \nyou really did run through your holiday clothes yup all of them are dirty so i didn't \neven bother putting them into separate bags you are just lazy \ni will let you do your own clothes i will only check the accessories and souvenirs okay \nit's for the best do you remember what you have bought \nthe dreamcatcher is one thing on the way home i also bought a cute little statue that can be used as a \npaperweight found it what's next the books that i brought with us \nthis thick lords of the ring fellowship of the ring book so this is what you were so deep into \nthat you left me waiting for an hour yesterday i can't believe it too time flies when \nthat book is in my possession have you finished it yet only half of it it's very \nlong i have no interest in being left alone because of a book \ni know i know i wouldn't let it get in our way anymore \nthank you so are there any other books i need to be aware of that's the only one i plan to bring two \nmore but there wasn't enough space in the luggage i've also held back my desire to buy one \nfrom the gift shop you did a great job child did you get anything from the gift shop \ngene no i wasn't very fascinated with anything in there \nthe woodworks aren't my style hey jean check if my phone charger is in there \nlet's see here it is thanks my phone needs it badly \n[Music] is that all you've got there is also my bag of personal hygiene \ncaring i will check the things inside myself apart from that there is nothing more to \nconcern where are your headphones by the way in my pocket here \ni've been using it quite a lot it's for the audiobooks you've been talking about \nand for my weird music days too well you do you then \nso my luggage passed your test pretty much \ngreat because i have some business to do in the bathroom get going then \ni'll join you later don't miss me too much i don't want you to watch me unpack my \nluggage anyway [Music] \nworking part-time jobs daniel is hiring some employees to work \na part-time job mike is one of the applicants \nhello mike take a seat thank you sir \ncan i see your resume please i have received the online version of \nyour cv but i just wanted to be sure here you go sir \neverything you require is in that document case you got quite an interesting history for \na student of your age mike there seems like nothing is out of the \nordinary just relax kid this is just for a part-time job \nusually these so-called interviews aren't as strict as the more long-termed ones \nbut nevertheless i want you to know if you are right for the job so tell me mike what brings you here \nwell sir i wanted to apply for a part-time job to get used to the roughness of society \nso through hours of applying i'm here and do you expect to be paid handsomely \nno i don't sir the experience of working is enough to keep me going \ni'm sorry if this is offensive but no undergraduates apply for a part-time job without having money as a goal in their \nmind i understand sir and i am sorry \nplease just call me dan or mr dan and no need to be sorry so how has your university life \nbeen mike it has been great actually i'm a freshman of international business \nmajor i've managed to become an official member of one of my school's clubs \nbeing socially open aren't ya it's nice to see one fit in easily with \nhis surroundings so i assume that you are communicating skill is at a decent level \ni wouldn't really consider my talking skills anywhere near charming but still \nnatural nevertheless cool that's all i expected mike \nnow how about your other skills such as multitasking or concentration \ni'm not very good at multitasking but i can put my mind into a single thing for \na long period of time that is very beneficial in the future \nfor you what about your time management ability \ni know that freshman year at university can be overwhelming but \ncan you be self-organized enough to make sure the deadline is met \ni can prioritize particular tasks based on their importance so i am confident as \ni can mr dan your attitude is straightforward and honest isn't it mike \nbut anyway before we end this short interview i would like to advise you something \nleave out some time for you to rest and balance between studying socializing and working okay \nthank you for the advice mr dan i appreciate the advice \nwell then here is your resume have a good day sir \ngoodbye mike remember to close the door behind you \ndave is working a part-time job at a grocery store \njordan accidentally met him and sticks around to talk \ni will have these oh hey jordan long time no see \ndave oh wow i didn't expect to see an old homie around \nyeah it has been ages since we last met from high school isn't it \nsince we graduated oh wait let me check these out for you first \nit's 14.65 here are your groceries mind if i stick around for a bit \nno problem bro it's not every day that i bump into an old mate \nand i'm not very busy at this time of day so how long have you been working here \nfor about a month and a half or so it's pretty uneventful working here so \nthis job is fine but this is only a part-time job though \ni haven't graduated yet well it's only two years since we left \nhigh school i only started university a year ago for multiple \nreasons really which university do you attend it would sound a bit odd but have you \nheard about the university of people it's kind of familiar but i can't really \npinpoint what it is i swear i have heard about it somewhere \nit's a free university where people around the world can attend for free as \nlong as they have an internet connection and a full commitment \noh i remember that university is very well known for its good deeds and dedication \nyes i'm really glad and excited when i got recommended by a relative \nmy life has really turned up from there because i'm flexible in my study i still \nhave time to work some part-time jobs to feed myself and help out my parents \nthis is only my nighttime job my daytime job offers wage but it's \nequally more stressful what do you do here anyway \ni never get an insight about this sort of work well as the cashier my main job is to \nscan these groceries and collect the money but behind the counter there are a lot \nof other minor things to do such as when the manager isn't here i'm \ntasked with recording and writing down any cargo delivery and report it to him \nkeep the shelves stocked and deal with any product shortages \napart from the regular works i have to deal with every emergency around \nsometimes that fridge over there breaks down or the front door is jammed etc \nusually there would be a guy working the same shifts as me but today he is coming late \nhe told me that he would arrive an hour late which means he will be here in \n10 minutes so i'm the only one keeping you company \nyeah pretty much i appreciate this it could get extremely \nboring around here anytime man anytime \nso how much do you guys earn from working here typically eight dollars an hour every \nday there are no extras in rush hours or holidays \nthis place would close during holidays or maintenance days but there are great pulses at this place \ni get to be paid every weekend so i can keep up with any surprise bills \nthat's great for you man i hardly know anywhere else with such good policies \nbut anyway it's a dead-end job nevertheless \nwhat about the other jobs you have well i also work around the logistics \ncenter next to the supermarket i'm only the apprentice at the place \nfollowing the manager where he does his daily routine i've learned a lot of things there \nalready the boss there took great care of me things seem to be looking up for ya huh \nwould there be any chance it would lead to a full-time job most likely yes i saw a lot of potential \nfor growth at the place on the online university i talked about \nthere is a logistics course really suited for my needs in only one year i've got most of the \nbasic knowledge of how to run a logistics business and manage \nworking at this place also gives me hands-on experience and logistics \nthat's why i stayed at this place working at a seemingly minimum wage \nwow you got such an admirable spirit for studying and working \ni'm really impressed with how everything has turned up for you opportunities come from education \ni'm happy for you man seeing an old dude thriving thanks man \nyou're a nice guy well it's about time for me to go \nkeep up the good work okay my dude i will man i will \ngoodbye dude [Music] \nthanks for watching don't forget to like share comment on my video \nplease subscribe to learn english with jessica channel to watch more helpful \nvideos goodbye \nyou \n"
