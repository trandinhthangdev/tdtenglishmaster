    "transcript": "Intro \nOh, hey hey. \nThere she is! \nHuh, who? \nHelen, your crush! \nOMG, what should I do now? \nQuick! Take your chance! \nCalm down. \nI don't know what to say. \nJust be yourself. \nTry your best. \nUm... hello Helen. \nHi, Glenn. \nWhat's going on? \nUm... can I ask you something? \nYeah? \nWhat would you like to ask? \nWhat's your favorite way\nto spend a weekend? \nHm... sometimes I just stay home, \nYou know. \nSurf Facebook, Youtube or something like that. \nOh... But sometimes I also go for a jog. \nReally?... Well, I also like jogging. \nWhere do you often jog? \nUm yeah... Stanley Park. \nIt's great there. \nI'm getting bored of jogging alone. \nLet's go for a jog together this weekend. \nReally? \nYeah, we'll meet at 10 am, \nthen go jogging together. \nWhat do you think? \nThat's great. Helen. \nI'll text you through. \nHere's my Facebook. \nI think... it would be fun if we... \ngo have lunch together... \nI agree! \nOh... Great! \nWell, I have to go. \nCongratulations, man. \nOh my god, I still can't believe it. \nI got one with one hit. \nBooks \nWhat's the matter, Claire? \nOh. Hello, Leon. \nI have a headache with the assignment in academic English. \nAh, writing a report about a book? \nI don't think it's difficult. \nBut I don't have any books at home. \nHave you read any good books lately? \nCan you lend one to me? \nOf course. \nI have quite a few good books. \nWhat type of books do you like to read? \nUm... I don't know. \nI hardly read books, you know. \nName a few! \nA Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking. \nEw, the name sounds weird. \nIt's a very good book about the universe and physics. \nNope. \nDoesn't suit me at all. \nThen I have 20,000 Leagues under the sea. \nA fascinating science fiction novel. \nNo, I don't like reading science books. \nSuggest another one. \nGuns, Germs, and Steel. \nA fantastic book about human history and politics. \nNo, I don't like history at all. \nIt's boring. \nWell, this is hard. \nCan you take classic literature? \nI think so. \nSo let's try The Thorn Bird. \nI think it really suits you. \nOkay, then I'll try. \nI'll come over for the book tonight. \nOf course. \nBooks before bed \nWow...  \nAre these all yours? \nYep. \nDid you read them all? \nI just take them one by one. \nActually, some of them I haven't finished. \nWhen do you read books? \nI like to read books before bed. \nSometimes stories are even repeated in dreams. \nWow. You really love books. \nWhy? \nI don't know, Claire. \nIt happened after I read the first book in my life. \nHearts. \nBut you know, \nI feel sleepy when trying to read a book. \nThat's the problem. Don't try. \nlet your imagination be, naturally. \nImagination? \nWhat is your dream, Claire? \nI don't know. \nThat's because you don't have an imagination. \nForm it up slowly with books. \nUm... So could you lend me the first book you read? \nHearts? Yeah. \nOh, okay. \nIt's a good start. \nSports clubs \nHi, Alex. \nOh hi Joyce. \nHow's it going? \nI'm fine. \nDo you have any plans for sports clubs? \nSports? \nI haven't even thought about it. \nThere are many sports clubs at school. \nI think you should join some of them. \nBut for what? \nFirstly, health benefits. \nHave you study all day without exercising? \nYou'll be very weak, right? \nUm... I guess. \nMoreover, sports clubs have many participants, \nSo you can expand your network. \nGreat, so what sports do you think I should choose? \nShould we choose the volleyball club? \nIt's not so hard. \nI think it's a good place to start. \nWhat do you think about basketball? \nOh no, one person in my family playing basketball is enough. \nWho is that? \nMy sister. \nReally? \nReally, my sister is taller than me. \nHmm, why don't we try swimming? \nSwimming can make you as tall as her. \nBut do we have enough time\nto join two clubs? \nEach operates two times a week. \nWe can arrange our time. \nWe can schedule our time. \nReally? Let me see... \nIs it okay? Every Monday and Thursday. \nWe will take volleyball on Monday, \nthen take swimming on Thursday. \nOkay. \nCulture anthropology \nHey Leon, how's the group project on Geography? \nI'm just finishing my part. \nWhat about you, Henry? \nI've gathered some information, such\nas terrain features and areas and so on. \nOf state. \nPlus, I will include some peripheral territories \nalong with their history\nin the presentation. \nCool. That would be great. \nWhat about your part, Leon? \nAs discussed, I will go deep into culture and anthropology, \nand I found some pretty interesting facts. \nOh, what's the most interesting fact you know? \nThe US society was once known for its \"melting pot\" style. \nWhat does that mean? \nIn the past, many ethnic groups immigrated to America. \nThey lived and integrated into American culture. \nAbsolutely. \nBut they have no cultural identities of their origin. \nYou can find Asian or African American descendants \nwho know nothing about the customs of their ancestors. \nThat's right. \nHowever, our society is gradually shifting to the \"Salad Bowl\" style. \nMeaning? \nIt means that immigrants retain\ntheir cultural identities, \ncreating communities with their own\nculture, education, and lifestyle. \nThey even receive support\nfrom the government for this. \nOh I see. \nimmigrants from other countries\nin recent years \npractice their customs\nright in this country. \nExactly. \nThe phenomenon is worth discussing. \nOkay. \nLet's include that in the presentation. \nWork culture \nHello Mr. Clark! \nOh, hello Betty. \nHow was your internship? \nIt's all new. \nThere was so many thing I never thought about. \nWhat's something new you've learned this week? \nThe first is how companies operate, \nTotally different from how I was thinking. \nHow? \nI often imagine typical scenarios when mentioning companies, \nlike formal clothes, boring offices, \ntense meetings or fierce arguments. \nThat's how it was. Back in my time. \nYes, but things are different now. \nThe first interesting thing\nis the way it all works. \nThe company I'm interning with\nhas nearly 100 employees, \nbut many of them rarely work in the office. \nReally? How did they work? \nIt's all online, sir. \nThey only present at the company\non a fixed day of the week. \nFor the purpose of meetings or handovers. \nExactly, that's the current trend. \nFurthermore, working hours are flexible. \nSome employees go there for just a few minutes or a few hours and then go home. \nDon't they keep track of their time? \nNo, all work performance is measured through KPIs. \nIt could be sales, deadlines, etc.. \nWe must admit that the fixed-time working model is obsolete. \nYes. So employees have more time\nfor other commitments and families. \nSurprisingly, the company's capacity\nis higher than others in the field. \nYou had a pretty impressive\nweek of learning. \nBe prepared to welcome more novelties next week. \nRelieve stress \nHey, Peter. \nHi Steven, \nHow was your day? \nTerrible, everything's terrible. \nOh. I'm sorry. \nYou guys are so lucky that you don't have\nto deal with those crazy customers. \nWell, dealing with partners isn't easy either, pal. \nBut the partners at least do things\naccording to agreements. \nCustomers always ask for the Moon. \nAlso, they're extremely unreasonable. \nI'm mad at them. \nPeter! Calm down. \nIt's stressing me out. Stephen! \nCome on, we have some drinks. \nAll right. \nHow do you usually relieve stress\nafter a long day? \nWell, I have plenty of ways. \nWhen I first started going to work,\nI played video games. \nBut now that I have a family, \ntaking care of them after hours is one of my things. \nIsn't it tiring to take care of others? \nI didn't say human. \nI mean my wife and the cats. \nWell, pets help us relieve stress, right? \nOf course. \nHow they treat us, their sincerity, etc. \nit all makes me feel comfortable\nafter having to deal with humanity. \nI think I'll get a dog. \nCan you show me some things that need to do? \nOf course. \nVisiting grandparents \nHey Betty, \nYesterday I saw you waiting for the bus at Main Street. \nReally? Where were you at that time? \nIt was unfortunate I couldn't call you. \nI was in a friend's car. \nWhere were you going then, Betty? \nI visited my grandparents. \nYour grandparents? \nThey must live in North Vancouver. \nOh, no. \nThey just live in the surrounding area. \nThere are quiet neighborhoods there. \nUnlike downtown. \nBut wait, so you have your origin here? \nIs there any white person that was born in North America? \nMy family has Scottish origin, \nthey were among the first pioneers in BC. \nMy grandparents are already\nthe 5th generation. \nWow. So your house must be very old. \nThat's right, that house was built by my great-great-grandfather himself, \nAfter a few generations of wandering. \nWhat a family with deep traditions. \nMy grandmother makes delicious Beaver Tail, \nbetter than the ones sold on Grouse Mountain. \nOMG! Next time, can I go with you\nto your grandparents house? \nI'll talk to my parents first. Okay? \nThe elderly often have regulations. \nFine. Tell me if it\u2019s okay \nFinding an apprentice \nHey Brian, why a long face? \nLeon! I'm desperate. \nWhat's so bad? \nI haven't found an apprentice chance, \nDon't you plan on going to College? \nYes, but I want to take advantage \nof the summer days and free time to learn a trade. \nYou know, when we're college,\nstudents will have lots of time, \nCan't waste it on useless things! \nYou have so much foresight. \nI have never thought about this. \nBut you're right. \nHey Brian!I know someone who can help you. \nWho is that? \nThat's my brother! \nHe's a businessman. \nIs that the brother who is more than ten years older than you? \nIs he difficult? \nOh. Don't worry. \nMy brother's funny. \nReally? I feel better now. \nBut if I ask him too much,\nis he going to be upset? \nAlthough he does business, he is also a teacher. \nHe really likes being asked questions. \nGreat. \nAnd he gives enthusiastic instructions at work. \nYou won't miss the opportunity\nto apprentice with him. \nI feel quite keen now. \nHe has a lot of knowledge. \nI'm sure you'll learn more\nwhen you're with him. \nOkay, so when can I start? \nYeah, let me confirm with him first. \nOkay! \nOutdoor skills \nHow are you, Leon? \nHi Claire, I'm good. \nHow was your weekend? \nGreat, I read most of the book. \nHow about you? \nWhat did you do last weekend? \nI went on a trip with my brother,\nwith some of his friends. \nOh. Where did you guys go? \nWe camped at Mount Baker. \nThere's quite beautiful scenery there. \nIs that all? \nNot really. \nThere, my brother performed an interesting demo lesson. \nWhat kind of lesson? \nOutdoor skills. \nSounds strange. \nSure, there weren't many courses like that. \nIt's a course that instructs the basic skills needed in the wilderness, \nsuch as camping, trekking,... \nOh, like survival skills? \nNo, survival skills is broader, \nAlthough my brother have a lot of experience, \nHe never claims to know everything about it. \nSo when does he perform his next class? \nMaybe next weekend or a few more weeks? \nI don't know. He's quite busy. \nIt must be a great passion for him to spend his precious weekend doing this. \nThat's right, my brother is close to nature. \nHe started camping when I was in elementary school. \nHey, let's ask your brother to hold another demo class. \nI'll get some classmates to go. \nGood idea. \nAnd we can provide feedback that will help make his course better. \nGreat, thanks Claire. \nMorning routine \nCoffee again, Dylan? \nWhy not, Steven. \nThis is great. \nI always want to have it as a morning starter. \nCool. \nHow do you prefer to start your day? \nMy perfect day must start with an effective workout at the gym, \nfollowed by a nutritious breakfast, \nand a bottle of electrolyte water is indispensable. \nOh, you don't drink coffee? \nAbsolutely not. \nDo you know? Coffee or other stimulants, \nif they are used for a long time, \nThey're harmful to your nervous system. \nI know, but there's nothing else\nto wake my brain up. \nThere is. \nI stimulate my brain with movement. \nYou see, \nI often take a short nap on weekdays at the office. \nBut on weekends or vacation trips,\nI rarely do that. \nHow come? \nPhysical activities such as climbing, setting up camp,... \nThey all help me stay awake. \nWhy is that? \nOur human bodies are not designed to sit forever. \nBut it's our job. \nHow can I improve? \nIt's actually simple. \nIf you use your brain to work, you have to\nmake your body move during breaks. \nOn the contrary, if you do manual jobs, \nyou have to train your brain\nwhenever you have time. \nI got it. \nIf my body is healthy,\nthe brain will be clear. \nIf my brain works well,\nthe body will work more accurately. \nExactly. \nSo after work,\ncould you take me to your gym? \nOkay. \nOutdoor activities \nWhat's wrong with you, Nelson? \nI hate being outside and having the wind\ntapping my face like this. \nHome is the best. \nNo wonder why you feel cold on a cool day. \nYou should do exercise. \nErm... I don't like waking up early. \nDo you enjoy outdoor activities? \nNever, what about you? \nYes, definitely. \nSo you're a sports star, huh? \nOh, no. \nI don't play sports. \nMy outdoor activities are hiking and camping. \nOh, I've been hearing about this,\nbut I've never experienced it. \nThen we can arrange a whole day. \nI will give you an experience\nof being close to nature. \nBut I'm quite afraid of insects\nand snakes. \nDon't worry, if we settle carefully, we should be able to avoid most of them. \nFurthermore, snakes actively avoid humans. \nSo what about predators? \nAre there any risks from them? \nOf course yes, \nbut that's only if you trespass on their territory. \nTo be safe, \nLet's just stay in the place\nas allowed by the ranger or landowner. \nWell, I've changed my mind. \nI don't fit such adventurous hobbies. \nMaybe I'll find a marathon club. \nFine. I'll connect you to a group I know. \nBirthdays \nYou're the new employee, Naomi, right? \nYes. How can I help? \nI'm Dori from Human resources. \nI would like to ask about your birthday. \nThe company has a birthday celebration event for employees born in the same month. \nOh, yes. \nMy birthday is in June. \nOh, is that so? \nI also have my birthday in June. \nWhat day were you born? \nI was born on the 21st, what about you? \nI was born on the 12th. \nOh, what a coincidence. \nIndeed, it was like fate that I came to work here. \nWhat made you think that? \nI tried to find a job for weeks,\nbut still no result. \nEvery day, I stayed at home to do hustle jobs, \nlike copywriting, or proofreading. \nNot much, but enough to survive, right? \nAbsolutely. But there were demands. \nI didn't want to be like that forever. \nSo what did you do? \nThat day, I was supposed to complete two proofreading tasks, \nBut instead, I decided to take the dog for a walk to clear my head. \nAnd by chance, I met Jaime,\nthe head of human resources, \nwho was also taking a walk. \nMy dog Max kept clinging to him, \nand he also really like Max. \nSo you have to thank Max. \nSure! \nAfter that, we talked a lot, and Jaime\narranged a placement for me here. \nAfter hearing about my situation. \nAnd it's fortunate to meet a person\nwho was also born in June in this company. \nHahaha! \nYes, I hope I can do my job well. \nWe will always give support,\nso don't worry. \nThank you Dori. \nDate \nYo Viet, you good? \nYo Carlos, fine as hell. \nHow was a date with your crush, \nBetty? It was nice. \nWe talked for a while, \nSet a date, and then we watched a good film yesterday. \nSo, the date was so successful. \nYes, but I still feel confused. \nWhy is that? \nShe paid for everything on our first date. \nSo what? \nObviously that's not normal. \nShouldn't men be the ones to pay? \nI don't know what Asian culture is like,\nbut here things are not like that. \nReally? \nYeah, remember \nDid she use the word invite\nwhen talking about going to the cinema? \nHmm... Yes. Absolutely yes. \nI remember every word vividly. \nSo that means she would pay. \nHere, everything is transparent. \nIf you want to pay, say you're inviting. \nIf you want to share, say so. \nOh, so simple. \nIn my home, it is impolite to let a woman\npay for the first few dates. \nNot here. \nWelcome to North America. \nHahaha. Cool. \nI feel Betty is a wonderful person. \nI will invite her on our next date. \nGreat. \nFavorite childhood memory \nAlright professor, and let's go on with the next question from the students. \nWhat is your favorite childhood memory? \nTo be honest, my childhood was not very remarkable. \nIt was quite calm with my family, \nmy parents and my sister. \nMy favorite memories come mostly from my time in college. \nReally? \nCan you name a memorable one? \nYes, I was 19 years old that year. \nI had heard a lot of talk about interstate highways, \nand to my family, who had been farmers \nall their lives in remote southeast Texas. \nThe highways were something strange. \nAnd what did you do? \nAt that time, I had just finished getting my driver's license. \nMy dad told me to go buy some animal\nfeed using the family's pickup. \nSince it was my first time, I had to look at the map as I drove. \nafter loading the last packages\ninto the truck, I looked at the map \nand realized I was only a few dozen\nkilometers from highway 45 for life. \nOh, I feel it was stimulating for you. \nThat's right, I didn't think much. \nthrough the map on the passenger seat \nand hit the gas toward route 45. \nWhere did you go? \nDallas, there I took Route 20 east, \nthen turned right into a small road south to go home. \nIt was reckless, at that time there was no Google Maps. \nYou only had a paper map in your hand, \nYouth, man. \nMy father chased me through the cornfield that night \nwhen he saw me showing up at 5 p.m.. \nHe must have been upset and worried. \nThat's right. \nBut after he heard my story,\nhe pondered for a moment. \nWhy was that, sir? \nI didn't know what my father was thinking, \nbut the next day he asked me to drive him back the way I had gone \nFrom then on, my father and mother worked less hard and traveled more often. \nFor the first time in more than 40 years of their lives, \nThey traveled out of Texas. \nThat's meaningful, sir. \nI can see that traveling and changing between places make our lives better \nYou are right. \nTherefore, I will never stop moving. \nEven though I am over 60. \n"
