is it no not too far don't worry joey \nokay sounds good let's go [Music] \nGiving Gifts \ngiving gifts \n[Music] eliza \nhave you planned anything for the holiday yet i am thinking about it \ni need to prepare some gifts for my parents when i come back home \nyes the holiday season is coming up and many kinds of gifts for new year's are now available at the market \nnew year is the biggest holiday in my country so gifts are necessary \nso when do people give gifts or presents in your country in my country people give presents on \nsome different occasions such as wedding anniversaries birthdays \nparents day or valentine's day perhaps when people buy their first \napartment or home they also give gifts people also give gifts during religious \nfestivals like christmas holidays and sometimes they give gifts at graduation \nceremonies i agree \nwhat kinds of gifts do you usually choose i usually take something like some \nflowers for my grandmother i know she loves flowers so they always make her happy which is great \ni give chocolate and jewelry for women while wallets are watches for men since \nthese are very much useful in a man's everyday life i think you like giving expensive gifts \nright yes i feel like giving valuable presents \nmeans giving importance to the person who receives the gifts but i think those gifts still have \nreasonable price and are decent you know i'm not as generous as i should \nbe and i'm rather tight-fisted when it comes to usually giving presents only on \nbirthdays yeah we should only make sure that the gift \nwill bring a smile to the face of the receiver that's true \ndo you spend a lot of time choosing gifts i really enjoy looking for gifts for \npeople because it is really gratifying to be a part of a good cause \nespecially if it involves making someone happy \nwell i am totally the opposite for me it also gives me an idea as to \nwhat kinds of new gift items are available at the market because you work in the industry \nthat makes sense what about your time while choosing presents \nso to answer your question i love to buy a suitable gift for others but i do not spend hours after hours \ndoing so instead i visit a large shop or an online store that has numerous gift \nitems and then i quickly pick a gift but do you think sending gifts is \nimportant of course yes the purpose of giving \ngifts is to show how much someone means to us and to celebrate the person who the gift is in honor of \ni would like to add that it can also be aimed at amending our past bitterness \nand misunderstanding in order to refresh our relationship \non the other hand giving and receiving today has become a commercial activity \nsometimes we are forced to give and receive gifts i totally agree with your point \nnowadays presents are much more symbolic rather than substantial or useful \npeople these days often give and receive technology related gifts which were quite rare in the past \ni would say that in the past specifically 10 years ago the types of gifts exchanged were \nprimarily clothes toys household appliances and books apart from the fact \nthat they weren't related to technology they were also significantly important \neducational and in most cases really expensive \nglobalization has given us products from more places around the world to enjoy \nand online shopping has made it a lot easier for us to acquire them without \nthe hassle of going to shops i only like something practical \nit might be kind of boring but i like to get things like socks and underwear because i always need those \nand i don't like shopping for those things \ni rarely see anyone giving underwears presents dan \nthat's my dream or perhaps food or drink food or drink is more suitable \nif it's a friend's house then i will give you a bottle of wine or something like that \noh i just realized i often have different ideas for gifts i also tend to travel a lot so i always \ntry to bring back souvenirs for family and friends so i can share in some small way my experience \ndo you prefer sending or receiving gifts \ni like to be given something it's exciting to unwrap a present and see what it is \nalso it shows that someone cares about you or maybe it just means they want something in return \nso what is the last time you received a gift oh this is hilarious just a couple hours \nago i received a bag of sweet potatoes from the owner of the mini supermarket at the corner of my street \ni still don't know why she gave me but she said not to worry about paying for them \nit was a complete surprise but a really nice gesture by her \nis she close to you that much not really that's why i was quite shocked \nwhen is your last time my friends presented me with a few books \non my last birthday they bought four novels that they knew i wanted to read and surprised me on my \nbirthday two of these books are written by john grissom \nthe other two are the fault in our stars and the handmaid's tale \ni know those two books too the content is really good \nyes and i received some money on my birthday as well what do you think about giving money as \na gift it's a down-to-earth choice since then the receiver can put that money to use \non pressing matters or get something that they will really enjoy and it's a safe \nchoice for events like birthdays or weddings that's true \nanyway i'm going to the supermarket now to have a look at gifts \nbye hope you choose many knife gifts for relatives \n[Music] \nWedding \nwedding situation one amelia and her daughter sophie go to her \nfriend's wedding sophie is so excited she asks her mom about the wedding she has attended \nwow everything is so pretty like paradise i like this pink theme what do you think \nmom [Music] i like it too a beautiful wedding is every girl's \ndream even myself back then i saw photos of your wedding it was \namazing too mom the most important thing was to marry my favorite person which is your dad \ni hope that i have a wedding like that one day how much do you reckon it costs to pull \nthis wedding off i think it cost them a lot of money \ndo you hope to have a wedding as big as theirs i don't think so i want to have a bigger \nwedding why do you want to have a bigger wedding i want to have a large wedding that \neveryone will remember you can have a small wedding and people \nwill still remember it as long as you marry your love your wedding will be perfect \nhave you ever attended someone's wedding who were they yes a lot \nsome of my cousins friends colleagues but the most memorable one is my best \nfriends who went with you i went with one of my classmates \nwhere was the wedding organized it was held in a restaurant downtown \nwas it amazing how many people were there \nit was great and it was a small wedding only her close friends and relatives were invited \nwhat did people do at the wedding they enjoyed the wedding feast \nsang and danced together after giving the couple the best wishes of everlasting happiness \nwhat did the bride and groom wear the bride wore a white wedding gown \nwhile the groom wore a black suit in thai what was the most interesting ritual at \nthe wedding exchanging rings is the ritual i'm quite interested in \nit was so emotional a lot of people cried the groom and bride's eyes were \nsparkling and then i knew they were meant for each other \nour weddings especially venton's one's life yes along with birthdays \nbecause we only marry once or taught twice usually and the ceremony is intimate and special \nthings like that don't happen a lot do people get married early \nnot really the average age to get married for women is 27 and for men is \n29. what is the ideal age to get married in your opinion \nwell 27 would be my ideal age women are most charming and mature at \nthat age i guess how have weddings changed recently \nthe most noticeable change is the reduction of rituals in a wedding \nthere used to be more steps in weddings years ago than there are now like what mom \nfor example after the ceremony the bride had to speak to her parents first \nor the family of the bride would essentially pay the husband to be a sum of money \nas a sort of thanks for being willing to marry their daughter that's so strange nobody does that \nanymore and the couple needed to bury a bottle of bourbon at their wedding site \nexactly one month before the ceremony to have a sunny sky on their wedding \nit was more complicated and superstitious back then i want a simple wedding without any of \nthose old-fashioned and weird traditions sure honey \nwhen it's about time we will plan your wedding together thank you mom it will be so much fun \n[Music] \nWedding Traditions \nsituation two henry flies to america from england to attend his friend michael's wedding \nhe's curious about the wedding traditions in america so he discusses with michael's friend dave about the \ntraditions in england in america hi henry welcome to america \nthank you so much for being here it means a lot michael it's my pleasure \nthis is the first time i attended an american wedding i'm so excited \ncome this way this is your seat thanks so i heard that american weddings are \ndifferent from weddings in england couples living in england do not have as many pre-wedding activities as those in \nthe united states really what activities do you guys have \nwell we do have bachelor and bachelorette parties we do not hold bridal showers or rehearsal dinners \nare bachelor and bachelorette parties in the uk different from those in the us \nwhile the party themes in the uk are extravagant the budget isn't excessive \nthe average brit spends about 507 euros on their weekend pre-wedding parties \nin the u.s bachelor party attendees spend on average of 738 dollars for the \nfestivities while bachelorette party attendees spend about 472 dollars \nthe actual ceremony is quite different too oh \nin england the wedding party is usually small the bride walks down the aisle before \nher bridesmaids the groom keeps his back towards the bride as she walks down the aisle \nin here the groom faces the bride for the entire procession but i think the british tradition is better \nthat's the tradition we love most the groom faces away from the bride until she reaches him \nand everyone gets to experience their first look how about the bridesmaids and groomsmen \nin the uk instead of a maid of honor a bride selects a chief bridesmaid \nbritish bridesmaids sit during the ceremony while most american bridesmaids stand beside the bride throughout the service \ndo the groomsmen give funny toasts like in the u.s british wedding toasts are more like \nroasts but they're still polite and the jokes are pretty simple the speeches also don't take up much \ntime in america it's customary for the best man in the maid of honor to make a short \nspeech and maybe even one of the parents that's not something you'll see in \nbritish weddings only men tend to make the speeches and the main objective is to embarrass the \ncouple have you been to many weddings in your country \nactually this is the first wedding i've attended i heard that if you're british the first \nwedding you attend might be your own that's right the british have a strict rule \nno ring no bring if a couple is not married the guest's significant other is not invited to the \nceremony or reception following how about close friends and family \nmembers that are unmarried there's a separate reception later at night for those close friends and family \nunmarried guests are invited to bring their significant others to this reception \nthis person has to truly be a significant other oftentimes engaged to be invited \nin america we are given an open invitation for a plus one is this reception similar to the \nreception in the u.s dinner is served with dancing to follow \nthere is also a bar at the evening reception not at the morning reception lastly the couple often gives their own \ntoasts to each other and their guests at the evening reception \nthe evening reception is more intimate right yes but there's one key difference \nif you brought a gift you'll feel out of place really \nyes gifts are always mailed directly to the couple and never brought to the ceremony \nor reception that's a good idea a big gaudy array of wrapped presents \ndoesn't exactly make the party any better i know when i get married i will invite you so \nyou can attend an actual british wedding thanks i'm looking forward to it \nWeve broken up \nwe've broken up there are many reasons why people decide \nto end up in a relationship let's see this video and see the situation between emma and dee \n[Music] \nhey lily how do you do hi emma i'm all right long time no see \nis everything okay yes it's good i am planning to open my own store quite busy i don't think that \ni have too many things to prepare like

you know what he did \nwith me you will change your mind well it sounds serious what did he do \ndid you watch his the first cover song the first one was in the last year \nyou mean to the moon oh this video is so visual i remember that time teenagers \ngot crazy with it yes it reached 3 million views and he became famous \ni think it's so-so he isn't even a star but he started acting like an a-list \nceleb but it's just what he showed on social media as long as he still loves you and \ntakes care of you yeah if it's just on social media you \nknow he began ignoring all his friends he always lived in his virtual world \ni don't think he's that kind of person even he stopped taking care of me he was \nalways busy he considers himself the center of the universe \ncalm down emma did you try to talk with him to solve it yes definitely \nbut nothing changed he didn't realize what he was doing i also found out that he had flirted \nwith many girls on the internet we argued too much about this issue \nand there was one day dave did you feed plum \nyes absolutely you should bring him to the spa tomorrow to cut his hair \nokay are we going together um no i have to complete my new video and \nupload it it needs to be released at 7 30 pm so that it gets more interactions \nwhy do you always concentrate on social media every day like this you need to take time for me and your \nfriends in your real life as well emma you're not a baby anymore you know \nhow to take care of yourself don't you i have my own business to be done why don't you stand by me you just judge me \nevery time it hurts me so bad dave i don't want to talk with you right now \nbut you can ask your friends how you changed the stranger's opinions are not important i don't care \nokay it's up to you

a girl in front of my face \nshould i say congrats to the two of you i can't stand you anymore you make me \nlook like a dump i think we should break up what are you saying you were breaking up \nwith me have you thought carefully yes i'm so tired of you \ni've nothing to say to you anymore when we calm down we will talk about it \ndon't waste time anymore \nthen i got back to my room and cried all

no \nwords can describe you've got to see it for yourself wow that sounds wonderful i've thought \nof plenty of things we can do we can have a picnic in the park visit the famous harvard \nuniversity

come on in what are you carrying those bags look heavy let me help you \ncarry them inside thanks these are chestnuts chestnuts wow i can't believe they are \nselling chestnuts already autumn is really here i know right halloween is this weekend \nand it's gonna be thanksgiving soon anyway i saw some raw chestnuts when going grocery shopping at the local \nfarmers market yesterday they looked so good that i couldn't help it i bought some so that we will have \nsomething to eat while carving pumpkins today great idea roasted chestnuts are one of my favorite \nstreet food in the cold season but i always have been buying roasted chestnuts from street vendors \ni actually have never tried roasting them at home before don't worry roasting chestnuts at home \nare not hard at all i'll show you how to do that cool let's get to the kitchen \nso what do we do first we need to go through all the raw chestnuts we bought and pick out the \nbest ones how do we know which ones are not good \nlook at their shells the good ones will have hard and shiny shells they shouldn't be too light and rattle \nwhen you shake them ah okay let me see most of the chestnuts seem fine and not \nspoiled yeah i like to shop at the farmer's market because most of the food there is \nfresh right i agree oh i just found three chestnuts that are \ncracked it's best if we throw them away okay what's next \nwe need to wash them properly and dry them off because we'll touch the shells when eating \nall right done next we'll make an x-shaped cut on the shelf this step is \nreally important because it will prevent the chestnuts from exploding when being roasted \nah that's why then we'll put them in the oven right yeah it'll take 10 to 20 minutes we'll \nwait till shells burst open and the chestnuts look golden brown i see thanks for teaching me how to make \nroasted chestnuts i could do it at home now no problem \nwell we wait for the chestnuts let's switch to carving the pumpkins \nhere are the pumpkins we picked out on thursday let me find two sharp knives \nokay let's start by cutting out the top part do you need a spoon i often remove some \nof the flesh so it's easier to carve good idea can i also borrow a marker and want to \ndraw the face before i start carving here you are be careful when carving \nhey will thanks [Music] \nyou're done already so fast yep i'm done how does it look \nit looks amazing you are really an expert thanks i'm used to carving pumpkins \nsince i do this every year hey i think our chestnuts are done \nroasting they smell so good yay let's

quite an interesting history for \na student of your age mike there seems like nothing is out of the \nordinary just relax kid this is just for a part-time job \nusually these so-called interviews aren't as strict as the more long-termed ones \nbut nevertheless i want you to know if you are right for the job so tell me mike what brings you here \nwell sir i wanted to apply for a part-time job to get used to the roughness of society \nso through hours of applying i'm here and do you expect to be paid handsomely \nno i don't sir the experience of working is enough to keep me going \ni'm sorry if this is offensive but no undergraduates apply for a part-time job without having money as a goal in their \nmind i understand sir and i am sorry \nplease just call me dan or mr dan and no need to be sorry \nso how has your university life been mike it has been great actually \ni'm a freshman of international business major i've managed to become an official \nmember of one of my school's clubs being socially open aren't ya \nit's nice to see one fit in easily with his surroundings so i assume that you are communicating \nskill is at a decent level i wouldn't really consider my talking \nskills anywhere near charming but still natural nevertheless \ncool that's all i expected mike now how about your \nother skills such as multitasking or concentration \ni'm not very good at multitasking but i can put my mind into a single thing for \na long period of time that is very beneficial in the future \nfor you what about your time management ability \ni know that freshman year at university can be overwhelming but \ncan you be self-organized enough to make sure the deadline is met \ni can prioritize particular tasks based on their importance so i am confident as \ni can mr dan your attitude is straightforward and honest isn't it mike \nbut anyway before we end this short interview i would like to advise you something \nleave out some time for you to rest and balance between studying socializing and working okay \nthank you for the advice mr dan i appreciate the advice \nwell then here is your resume have a good day sir \ngoodbye mike remember to close the door behind you \ndave is working a part-time job at a grocery store \njordan accidentally met him and sticks around to talk \ni will have these oh hey jordan long time no see \ndave oh wow i didn't expect to see an old homie around \nyeah it has been ages since we last met from high school isn't it \nsince we graduated oh wait let me check these out for you first \nit's 14.65 here are your groceries mind if i stick around for a bit \nno problem bro it's not every day that i bump into an old mate \nand i'm not very busy at this time of day so how long have you been working here \nfor about a month and a half or so it's pretty uneventful working here so \nthis job is fine but this is only a part-time job though \ni haven't graduated yet well it's only two years since we left \nhigh school only started university a year ago for multiple reasons \nreally which university do you attend it would sound a bit odd but have you \nheard about the university of people it's kind of familiar but i can't really \npinpoint what it is i swear i have heard about it somewhere \nit's a free university where people around the world can attend for free as \nlong as they have an internet connection and a full commitment \noh i remember that university is very well known for its good deeds and dedication \nyes i'm really glad and excited when i got recommended by a relative \nmy life is really turned up from there because i'm flexible in my study i still \nhave time to work some part-time jobs to feed myself and help out my parents \nthis is only my night time job my daytime job offers wage but it's \nequally more stressful what do you do here anyway \ni never get an insight about this sort of work well as the cashier my main job is to \nscan these groceries and collect the money but behind the counter there are a lot \nof other minor things to do such as when the manager isn't here i'm \ntasked with recording and writing down any cargo delivery and report it to him \nkeep these shelves stocked and deal with any product shortages \napart from the regular works i have to deal with every emergency around \nsometimes that fridge over there breaks down or the front door is jammed etc \nusually there would be a guy working the same shifts as me but today he is coming late \nhe told me that he would arrive an hour late which means he will be here in 10 minutes \nso i'm the only one keeping you company yeah pretty much \ni appreciate this it could get extremely boring around here \nanytime man anytime so how much do you guys earn from working here \ntypically eight dollars an hour every day there are no extras in rush hours or \nholidays this place would close during holidays or maintenance days \nbut there are great pulses at this place i get to be paid every weekend so i can \nkeep up with any surprise bills that's great for you man \ni hardly know anywhere else with such good policies but anyway \nit's a dead end job nevertheless what about the other jobs you have \nwell i also work around the logistics center next to the supermarket \ni'm only the apprentice at the place following the manager where he does his daily routine \ni've learned a lot of things there already the boss there took great care of me \nthings seem to be looking up for you huh would there be any chance it would lead \nto a full-time job most likely yes i saw a lot of potential \nfor growth at the place on the online university i talked about \nthere is a logistics course really suited for my needs in only one year i've got most of the \nbasic knowledge of how to run a logistics business and manage \nworking at this place also gives me hands-on experience and logistics \nthat's why i stayed at this place working at a seemingly minimum wage \nwow you got such an admirable spirit for studying and working \ni'm really impressed with how everything has turned up for you opportunities come from education \ni'm happy for you man seeing an old dude thriving thanks man you're a nice guy \nwell it's about time for me to go keep up the good work okay my dude \ni will man i will goodbye dude [Music] \ncooking sophie and anna are going to make cakes \non their own to celebrate their parents 25-year wedding anniversary \nwatch the video about the conversation between bakery teacher john and two \ngirls about making cakes sister our parents 25 year wedding anniversary \nis coming soon do you have any bright ideas to celebrate the anniversary anna \nnot yet i just think that we will buy cake in the gift for them \nwhat do you think i want something surprising for them \nbecause it's their silver anniversary i agree with you but i didn't come up \nwith any ideas anna an idea springs to mind \nmake a cake by ourselves is that fine that's good but we don't know how to \nmake a cake uh search google everything is on it \ndid you forget that last time you over baked chiffon cake over time so it was burned \ncome on why do you always sound like a broken record i was a little bit careless at the time \ni have another great option do you want to hear it of course \nwe will take part in a baking class how do you feel why do you think of such bright ideas \nlike that i couldn't agree more when right now is that fine \nit's up to you i'm free so let's go right now \n[Music] \nhi welcome to mr john's baking class may i help you \nwe need to join a baking class this afternoon where can i apply for the class \nthis way please \ndo you register for a long-term course or one-day class does your center have a one-on-one class \nbecause we intend to make a cake for my parents wedding anniversary \ncertainly we have that here is the place you can register \nafter completing the procedure you can participate right now \nthank you so much you're welcome \ngood afternoon to girls \nso now i'll introduce myself first my name is john beckham \nyou can call me teacher john during the class hello teacher john i'm sophie \nthis is my younger sister anna hi teacher john it's great to study making cake with you \nit's my pleasure so let's get started with cupcakes \nthey are often called in special events like a grand opening party anniversary \nand so on yes i really like it so excited to make it \nso now let's guess which ingredients you need anna and sophie \nfor sure we must have flour eggs and vanilla or chocolate which depends on the taste of \ncupcakes what about sophie's idea well \nactually i just know only three ingredients above that's fine \nwhat kind of flour do we use girls do you know i don't \nneither do i we have to use self-raising flour because you will see that your cakes \nalways rise perfectly and more importantly that you get a consistent rise every time \nwhat ingredients else sophie i don't know \nboth of you forgot the most important things which are milk and butter \noh exactly it completely slipped my mind \nokay so now i'll list all ingredients we need to make this cake \nfirst of all as you mentioned they are eggs self-raising flour and vanilla \nextract we also need milk softened butter icing sugar and golden castor sugar \nteacher john why don't you use refined sugar instead of icing one \nsimply icing sugar dissolves quickly in cold water sometimes people keep it on hand just to \nadd to juices milkshakes and other cold beverages so what is the quantity of all the \nelements teacher john i'll tell you now 110 grams softened butter 110 grams \ngolden caster sugar 2 large eggs a half teaspoon vanilla extract and 110 grams \nself-raising flour that's all for the crust and these are ingredients for \nbuttercream 150 grams softened butter 300 grams icing sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla \nextract 3 tablespoons of milk you can add food coloring if you want \nbut today i'm just going to teach you the traditional cupcake with buttercream on it \nyes i saw those elements on my table and we have to determine them \nabsolutely are you ready [Music] yes we are ready to make cakes \nso let's set to work teacher john do we have to heat the oven \nfirst right that's right at 180 degrees celsius \nand then you fill a 12 cupcake tray with cases i'm done teacher \nokay next use an electric whisk be 110 gram softened butter and 110 grams golden \ncaster sugar together until pale and fluffy \nand then whisk in two large eggs one at a time scraping down the sides of the \nbowl after each addition softened butter teacher i forgot how to \ntake it out of the refrigerator so did i is it possible to use cold butter \nteacher john no we cannot we must use softened butter for this \ntype of cake why because such butter is capable of \nholding air and the creaming process is then butter traps that air \nwhile baking that trapped air expands from the heat and produces a fluffy baked good \nwow i can gain one more new knowledge about making cakes \nteacher drawn does it have the difference between room temperature and softened butter \nactually no it depends on your room's degree they can be interchangeable \nbut in the recipe we use softened butter right certainly \nwhat do we do next teacher after that add half a teaspoon vanilla \nextract 110 grams self-raising flour and a pinch of salt whisk until just \ncombined then spoon the mixture into the cupcake cases teacher john at this stage can i replace \nhot chocolate instead of vanilla of course as i mentioned above vanilla \nor chocolate depends on your taste even if you want the strawberry taste you can add it \noh thanks teacher [Music] \n[Music] sophie you still want to keep the vanilla taste \nthat's right i prefer vanilla to chocolate okay it's time to bake \noh my gosh i'm really excited about this step i like seeing cupcakes hatching during \nthe baking process yes most bakeries like this step \nokay so bake for 15 minutes until golden brown and a skewer inserted into the \nmiddle of each cake comes out clean leave to cool completely on a wire rack \nexactly 15 minutes teacher john right if cupcakes are over baked they'll \nbe burnt therefore we should set an alarm i got \nwhile we're waiting for baking we are making buttercream firstly whisk 150 grams softened butter \nuntil super soft then add 300 grams icing sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla extract \nand a pinch of salt \nthe next step is whisking together until smooth then beat in three tablespoons of \nmilk sophie and anna we should start off slowly to avoid the icing sugar cloud \nremember that i got it almost i whisk a mess away \njumping the gun alright we're almost finished \nthe final step 15 minutes is over so let's take those cupcakes out of the oven \nif wanting to color stir the food coloring now spoon or pipe onto the cooled cupcakes \nfancy that their colors are so beautiful so is mine \nand now we will make second cakes guess what red velvet cake or biscuits \nno we don't make biscuits anna because we did a little creamy cake \nwhat you said is a clue for me to guess what next we will make so what \ncelebration cake is that right teacher john totally correct \nso which taste of celebration cake do you like many tastes to choose from teacher john \nwhich taste do you suggest for the wedding anniversary i suggest honey and almond layer cake \nsimple elegant wedding cake or chocolate cake sophie doesn't like chocolate so i \ninclined towards honey and almond layer cake what about you sophie same idea as anna teacher john \nwell we decide to make almond and honey layer cake then yes \nlet's cut to the chase i will list all ingredients that we need \n280 grams unsalted butter softened 225 grams \nlight muscovado 140 grams clear honey plus two \ntablespoons three medium eggs plus four medium egg yolks \n280 grams plain flour 100 grams ground almonds \n1 teaspoon baking powder 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 125 milliliters of milk \noh really so many that's all the ingredients we need teacher john \nlots of ingredients that's just for the crust and these are for the swiss meringue \nbuttercream 300 grams unsalted butter softened 4 \nmedium egg whites 250 grams golden caster sugar 2 tablespoons of clear \nhoney candied almond is available so we don't have to make it \nits stage takes a lot of time we are all ready teacher john \nthe first step is also the longest step we heat the oven at 180 degrees celsius \nfirst now let's make the honey and almond sponges \ngrease cake tin and line the bases with baking parchment you can use an electric hand mixer to \nbeat the butter muscovado sugar and 140 grams honey until pale and fluffy \nteacher john i know the next step what do you do next \nadd the eggs and yolks one at a time beating after each addition until well incorporated \nthat's correct well done \nafter that whisk together the flour almonds baking powder and a quarter teaspoon of salt \nadd half of the flour mixture to the butter mixture and beat until just combined \nadd the vanilla and milk continuing to beat then add the remaining flour mixture beating until just combined \ni want to cry celebrating cake has many steps \nfight we have almost done the first step \nnext divide the mixture evenly between the tins and bake for 45 to 55 minutes \nor until a skewer inserted into the center of each cake comes out clean \nallow the cakes to cool for 10 minutes in their tins then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely \nleave the oven on for the candied almonds notice the time my students \nwhen do we move to the next step teacher making cakes requires patience and \nmeticulous characteristics i'm not this kind of person \nneither am i even so we just made cupcakes not celebration cakes \nno in spite of being tired i still want to make a celebration cake by myself \ni do too come on girls you can do it the second step is making honey syrup \nput two tablespoons honey and two tablespoons water in a small saucepan \nand heat for one to two minutes or until the honey has dissolved then set it aside \ndone then make the swiss meringue butter cream \nusing an electric hand mixer beat the butter until pale and fluffy \nput the egg whites and sugar in a clean heat-proof bowl over a pan of simmering water \nheat the mixture until the sugar has dissolved remove the bowl from the heat and using \nan electric hand mixer whisk for 10 minutes or until the mixture forms stiff \npeaks and has cold to room temperature next add the butter one to two \ntablespoons at a time and beat until the mixture is smooth and creamy beat in the honey and transfer to a \npiping bag filling with a one centimeter nozzle when do we finish teacher john \nmaking this cake takes much more time than i thought almost done girls don't give up only one \nmore step oh my god eventually i almost finished \nthis cake next assembling the cake step is also simple for you \nlevel the sponges by cutting off the domed tops and split each sponge in half to create four layers \nfix the bottom layer to a cake board or stand with a splotch of buttercream brush with the honey syrup and pipe a \nlayer of buttercream on top gently press the second layer on top and \nrepeat with the remaining layers cover the cake with a thin layer of buttercream then use a palette knife to \nscrape the sides clean pipe a ring of buttercream blobs around the top or spread a thick layer with a \npalette knife decorate with candied almonds \nwe finish how pretty the cake is \nyou helped us make two kinds of cake i'm so thankful for you teaching us teacher \njohn thanks a million teacher it's my pleasure and give my love to \nyour parents and tell them happy silver wedding anniversary thank you so much teacher john \nthanks teacher i'm going home bye bye goodbye see you soon bye girls see you \n[Music] in the beauty

100 [Music] \nsituation three thin and fat \nanna represents the thin team and william represents the fat team so anna why is it good to be thin \nin my opinion thin prevents certain diseases so it is good for your health \nit is good to be thin because you can buy any clothes and you can wear your clothes without any problems you have no \ndifficulty exercising you can eat everything and do not gain weight \nlike chocolate chocolate is so delicious but when you get fat you love chocolate \nand eat it you'll get fatter and thin is more attractive \ndo you want to oppose william yes teacher i think thin people usually \nhave less strength than fat people people with very low weight usually \nsuffer anemia fainting malnutrition etc \nsometimes it is difficult for thin people to choose clothes too it does not equal healthy \npersonally i think fat people are also very cute and charming in their own way \ndo you want to oppose anna maybe you're right but do you know that \nmany fat people struggle to breathe heart disease is common \nsometimes tying shoes is a challenge when fat people bend down fat people struggle to find clothing \nthat look good on them sometimes they can't wear the clothes they like i'm a girl so i understand when i won't \nbe able to wear what i like it's really sad but if we talk about clothes \nit's like judging a person by their appearance it isn't fair how you treat people is \nmore important than how you look no matter how fat you are wear what you like \nwhether it's vintage hipster girl punk gal or bright colors it is just fine find a \ndoctor who respects you and get regular checkups i want to say this for anyone who gets \nfat if you spend your life afraid of what others think in your fat it is a life \nhalf lived don't reject yourself embrace yourself with a daily hug a smile in the \nmirror every time you see yourself love yourself first because when you love yourself you will \nknow that you should lose weight or not what is good for your health \nyou speak very well william thank you you speak well to anna \nthanks anna and william both are awesome whether fat or thin we should keep a \nbalanced weight to protect our health we should exercise for a healthy body it's not good to be too thin or too fat \nas william said how you treat people is more important than how you look \nso if you are thin or fat it's not important love yourself and respect yourself first \nbut remember to exercise regularly [Music] \nsituation 4 basic opposite adjectives describing appearance \nhow does she he look like [Music] \nyou

talk about their current work hey lily over here \noh hi beth long time no see how have you been it's nice to see you again lily i'm \ndoing fine how about you do you work or study i'm okay i graduated last year and i'm \nnow in full-time employment and you i didn't go to college i went straight \nto cooking classes and finding jobs and now i'm working as a chef at restaurant downtown what is your job \ni'm currently an english teacher working for boston high school in new york \noh that's great why did you choose that job i was previously a lawyer and found it \nto be stressful and never had any free time so after quitting that job i thought \nteaching might be not as stressful and more time off was teaching your passion \nyes since i was a child but my family directed me to study law and now that i'm older i found out what \ni really wanted i remember cooking is also your passion right yes but lucky for me my family supports \nmy dream in my career do you enjoy your job most of the time it's very rewarding to \nbe able to help people every day and the students here are very hardworking and fun to teach \nworking at a restaurant is exhausting but people are so nice to me do you get on well with your co-workers \nyes fine i don't really see work as a part of my social life so i don't socialize with them i think it's more \nprofessional to be that way what was your first day like there were lots of teachers starting at \nthe same time as me so we all had a big induction day the senior teachers ran workshops with \nus to familiarize us with the systems they had and then we went for a work team \ndinner in the evening my first day at work was like any other day at the restaurant i started working \nright away and i have a supervisor to help me with the work it was scary at first what \nresponsibilities do you have at work all of the teachers main responsibility \nis to plan good lessons and then teach them on top of that we have several admin \ntasks like mark homework fill out attendance sheets and write report \ni'm on the dessert part of the kitchen staff team so i have to prepare fruits baking cakes all day \nbut i love my job would you change your job in the future \nyes i like working by myself so i would like to be my own boss \ni want to open my restaurant what is your typical day like at work \ni start the day by doing all the planning at home before going to work around three to print off my materials \nand then i teach all evening what would you change about your job \ni would like to have more freedom to teach outside the syllabus i get it at the restaurant they want me \nto follow the recipes but i want to put my ideas into baking what is the most important part of your \nwork i think that dealing with customers will be the most important part of my work \ni learned to be polite and keep smiling even with some of the more challenging customers \ni know i have to deal with some tough students parents and some stubborn kids but most of the time the kids are nice \nit's great seeing you doing what you love i'm so happy for you \nthank you me too and good luck with your dream plan thanks \n[Music] \nsituation two it's dave's first day to work and he calls his friend nick to ask for advice \nabout the first day of work hey nick it's dave \nhey what's up tomorrow is my first day of work at global complex and i need some advice on \nhow to make the best first impression your first day of work is very important \nit's foundational and sets a good start for your job going forward \nhow is the first day of work often like the first day is typically when you'll \nsee your work area learn your workflow and schedule meet your co-workers get familiar with \ndifferent areas of your office or building do i have to dress up \nyes dress up to make a good impression and sure you're meeting the company's dress code if everyone around you is \ndressed more casually you can adjust your clothing choices in later days \nhow early should i go rush hour traffic could make your mute take longer than a typical trip to the \nsame area and showing up for your job early is much better than being late \nare there any important documents that i should pay attention to you need to review employment contracts \nand take care of paperwork such as tax forms your new employer's health insurance coverage retirement plans \nvacation policy i don't know if i should ask many questions \nasking questions now will help you avoid mistakes in the future being inquisitive also shows that you \nwant to do well in your new position okay and should i make friends at work \nmaking friends will encourage your co-workers to think of you as one of the team a good friend could also help you \nadvance your career how should i do it smile be cheerful and introduce yourself \nto as many of your new co-workers as you can during breaks start conversations by \nasking which restaurants or coffee shops are nearby i can do that \nand eating lunch is a great way to make friends and find out more about the people you'll be working with \ni will make friends with people who can help me most i can get useful advice about how to \nsucceed at my new job that's a good idea learning from the right co-workers is \nimportant you should listen to people's conversations carefully and watch their behavior \nokay i will do that remember to pay attention to your body language sit or stand up straight to \navoid signs of nervousness or boredom such as touching your hair tapping your foot or yawning \ni will have a supervisor i'm so nervous around the boss if your supervisor sends \nyou an email or tells you to come to their office respond immediately this demonstrates both respect and enthusiasm \nokay but what if i made a mistake most employers understand if you make a few minor mistakes on your first day of \nwork remember that you'll have a chance to do better tomorrow okay is that all \nthe last thing is saying goodbye when you leave thank your supervisor for hiring you \nand let them know that you enjoyed the first day what if they feel talkative what should \ni say i'm so shy you can talk to them about your day and how you plan to handle future projects \nwish them a good night and tell them that you look forward to seeing them tomorrow okay thank you for your help you make me \nfeel less worried no problem text me if you need any help \nthanks [Music] \nthanks for watching don't forget to like share comment on my video \nplease subscribe to learn english with jessica channel to watch
