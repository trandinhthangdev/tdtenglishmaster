be more effective this \nway all right Emily let's give it a try but promise me we won't miss \nanything I promise we're in this together remember thanks Emily let's do \nthis you're not listening

up \nto just going through my things I made a list of things I'd like to buy for our \napartment again we just bought stuff last month I know but I feel like the place \ncould use a little more character you know H we're on a tight budget we can't \nkeep buying things all the time I'm just trying to make this place feel more like home don't you want that \ntoo I do but we have to be smart

think. \nit's a big problem I [Music] \nthink look at that Jamie can you believe how much trash they're leaving \nbehind it's horrible and the trash can is just right there how hard is it to \nthrow it away properly it's a big problem I think more \nand more people just don't care about the environment anymore maybe we should say something or \ninform the park officials I've thought about it but I don't want any trouble some people get \nreally defensive you're right but maybe we can do something else like organize a \ncleanup day for the park get the community involved that's a great idea we can show \nthem the right way and maybe they'll think twice before littering again again let's plan it the park deserves \nbetter and we can be the change agreed we'll make a difference \n[Music] together this is a great \nThat is a great idea. \n[Music] \nidea what about building a model volcano it's classic but it could be fun \nH I think it's a bit too predictable what if we create a project about renewable energy \ninstead renewable energy like solar and \nwind exactly we can discuss the benefits and challenges and maybe build a small \nmodel demonstrating how it works that is a great idea we could use \na small fan to represent wind energy and maybe some small solar panels \nyes and we can show how these sources can be alternatives to fossil fuels helping to reduce carbon emissions and \ncombat climate change Mia I'm really excited about this \nproject now we should start researching right away me too Liam let's gather some \nmaterials and make a list of what we need
