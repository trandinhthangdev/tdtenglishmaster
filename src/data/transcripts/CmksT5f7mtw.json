Did you do this? \nI don't understand what you're saying. \nGet me another chair now. \nYou dared to do it, but won't admit it. \nCheck the camera. \nYou'll know who did it. \nFine. \nWe're classmates, so stop arguing. \nThat's none of your business. \nWhy help him? \nLet's help each other. \nThere are no cameras in the class. \nI know you did it. \nGood morning, everyone! \nToday, I have a special introduction. \nThis is Emily, and she's going to be our teaching assistant this semester. \nHi, everyone. \nI'm Emily, and I'm from Finland. \nI used to work as a screenwriter,\nbut now I'm excited to try something new. \nSo I've joined as a teaching assistant\nto support Jessica and all of you. \nEmily will be assisting me with various tasks, \nand she'll be a great resource for all of you. \nPlease make her feel welcome. \nWelcome, Emily. \nI'm Nam from Vietnam. \nHello, Nam. \nVietnam is on the list of countries I will visit this year. \nI bet you will like my country. \nOf course I will. \nNice to meet you!

Let's do it. \nFantastic! This will be fun. \nHey, Somi, \nwant to team up for this exercise? \nYour offer... is accepted. \nThanks. \nPlease sit away from me. \nShe just looks beautiful outside. \nAre you Maxim? \nIt seems you haven't found anyone suitable to form a team. \nIt would be great if we could be a team. \nNo, I prefer to work alone. \nWe can support each other\nin answering English questions. \nI just need quiet to answer Jessica's questions, please. \nJoining me could make it easier. \nI can study alone. I don't need your help. \nI'm fine. \nThank you. \nDon't worry, Emily. \nMaxim is like that. \nCold, quiet, and prefers alone. \nYes. He's so unapproachable. \nHe'll warm up someday. \nI hope so. \nEmily. Can you help me? \nOf course. Flavio! I'm here to help. \nWhat's the question giving you trouble? \nIt's about describing my favorite hobby. \nOkay! So what's your favorite hobby? \nI like playing the guitar. \nAwesome choice. \nLet's practice. \nStart by saying my favorite hobby is. \nUm, My favorite hobby is playing the guitar? \nPerfect! Now, tell me more. \nWhat do you enjoy about playing the guitar? \nI enjoy making music and expressing myself. \nExcellent. \nNow let's add a bit more detail. \nMaybe talk about... when you started playing or a favorite song you like to play. \nI started playing last year, and my favorite song to play is \"Yesterday\". \nFantastic. \nYou see. It gets easier with practice. \nKeep it up, Flavio! \nThank you. Emily. This helps a lot. \nYou are amazing, Emily. \nThank you. \nAnytime! If you have more questions, just let me know. \nWe're all here to support each other. \nHe was very attentive listening to me instructing Flavio. \nHe must have wanted to ask me something, \nbut he was still shy. \nLet me create a chance for him. \nPlease stop walking back and forth. \nIt distracts me. \nI cannot... do... my answer to this question. \nOh, sorry. \nI didn't mean to disturb you. \nGood. \nWell, that didn't go as planned. \nI was only trying to help. \nIf he doesn't want it. \nJust let him be. \nI have a meeting with the principal, \nso I'm leaving a little earlier than expected. \nPlease submit your completed homework\nto Emily once you finish. \nI'll review them tomorrow. \nSure thing, Jessica! I'll take care of it. \nThank you. \nSee you tomorrow. \nMaxim, you missed the submission deadline. \nNormally, it would be rejected. \nBut it's your first time. \nI'll let it slide, but there won't be a next time. \nWhat are you doing? \nNo need to do that. \nI said it's your first time. \nI'll let it slide. \nJust throw it away. \nWhat are you thinking? \nDo you think that's cool? \nIf you had asked me for help from the start, \nyou might have finished your exercise faster and not submitted it late. \nI said it's your first time, so we can ignore it. \nWhy are you still stubborn? \nRules are rules. \nIs it so difficult to receive help from others? \nI don't need your help. \n... Fine, I won't ask you anything anymore. \nAbout your assignment, you can present it again to Jessica tomorrow. \nMaybe you should redone it tonight at home. \nOkay. Thank you. \nHello, Mr.Fedrick \nLately, we have a new teacher, our classroom seems small. \nYou could consider switching us\nto a larger classroom, couldn't you? \nOf course. Jessica. \nAnything you want to help you with your job. \nClass, attention, today, we will move to a larger classroom. \nHey, Gyaan, how's it going with the tag questions? \nI think I'm getting the hang of it. \nThanks for your help, Emily. \nYou're welcome. \nIf you have any more questions, feel free to ask. \nFlavio, you never listen! \nWell, maybe if you made more sense. \nAre they always like that? \nYes. They fight every day. \nI even thought they were lovers. \nHow could that be? \nOnly ex argue like that. \nDo you and your ex still... argue often? \nOh... I'm sorry, Emily. \nThat was too personal. \nI shouldn't have asked. \nNo worries, Gyaan. \nLet's just focus on these tag questions, okay? \nThank you, Alex! I wonder what it is. \nOpen it and find out. \nOh, the adventures of time. \nI did share that I liked \"The Giver\". \nI like \"The Adventures of Time\", whatever. \nAnyway, Alex. \nThank you. \nHow about a romantic comedy tonight? \nSounds good. \nI thought we were watching a romantic comedy. \nI've been wanting to see this one. \nHere's your favorite, a Mojito. \nThanks, babe. \nHere you are. \nAlex, you know I don't like Honey Orange Lemonade. \nReally? I thought you did. \nI've told you hundreds of times about that. \nEmily, is everything okay? \nOh, Jessica. \nYeah. I'm fine. \nIf there's anything on your mind, I'm here for you. \nThanks, Jessica. \nDon't, don't be him, don't. \nOh dear! He saw me... \nEmily, wait. \nI need to talk to you. \nWhat? \nI'm sorry, Emily. \nI miss us, miss what we had. \nCan't we go back to how things were? \nAlex, I don't want to hear it. \nThe past is past. \nLet go, Alex. \nIt's over. \nAlex? Great, not again! \nTwice a day? How quaint! \nEmily. Fancy meeting you here. \nWhat are you doing here? \nAre you following me? \nEmily, why so cold? \nDo you know how difficult it was for me to find you? \nSo don't find me. \nI don't want to see you, Alex. \nWhat do you want? \nI want to be your boyfriend again, Emily. \nIn your dream, Alex. \nYou can not make a mistake and then just come and apologize to me. \nWho do you think you are? \nWhy? Did you like someone else? \nIt none of your bussiness. \nLet go of me! \nIf you don't agree to be my girlfriend again. \nI'm not going anywhere. \nLet go of my hand. If not, I will call... \nWho to call? Your new lover. \nWhat is wrong with you? \nLet me go! \nNo one can love you except me. \nYou must know who you are, right? \nWhy did you change? \nYou always listened to me before. \nI was stupid before. \nI can't be stupid all my life. \nIt's him. \nHe's the guy from school this afternoon. \nDo you like him? \nAre you crazy? \nDo not disturb me any more. \nIf you don't explain clearly,\nI'm not going anywhere. \nYou can't cause trouble here. \nDon't do anything foolish. \nBe careful. \nGet out of here! \nYou... \nTake him out. \nYou're bleeding. \nIt's okay. \nIf the bleeding doesn't stop, what if you lose too much blood? \nYou need to go to the hospital. \nNo need. \nNo, you have to stop the bleeding, \nyou have to bandage it. \nI won't leave without making sure you're okay. \nThank you for helping me. \nI'm just doing my job. \nDo you work at this bar? \nYes. I'm the bar security guard. \nThat's why you look so... strong! \nSorry for getting you into this mess. \nHe tends to be imposing and violent. \nIt's not good for you. \nHe is my ex. \nHe betrayed me... twice. \nThe first time, he dated me\nand my colleague at the same time. \nThe second time is my best friend. \nYou forgave him twice. \nAm I so stupid? \nSorry, I didn't mean. \nYou don't need to apologize. \nIt's just my fault. \nI'm so stupid. \nNo, you're not. \nMy favorite job is screenwriting. \nBut AI, \nArtificial intelligence are causing mass unemployment among screenwriters, \nincluding me \nIn 2023, I joined Writers' Strike 2023. \nAnd at that time, my ex and best friend betrayed me. \nI changed my career, gave up the job I loved, \nand became a teaching assistant to make a living. \nThat guy doesn't deserve you. \nIt's the right thing\nfor you to give up on him. \nThank you. \nAs for the job you love, your dream, \nDon't give up. \nYou think so? \nLet's think about AI as a tool\nto support your work better. \nA colleague with large knowledge. \nAI can't replace humans, because we have... emotions. \nThank you, Maxim. I appreciate your kindness. \nBy the way,\nyou are a good teaching assistants. \nThank you. \nYou're not as cold fish as you look. \nCold fish? Is that food? \nI mean, you're not unfriendly. \nYou're so kind. \nHi, Nam. \nHey, Gyaan. \nHello, Flavio \nHi! \nMorning, Maxim. \nHi. \nWait, he greeted me back! \nAre you reading a book? \nUh-huh. \nIs it a good book? \nYeah. \nGood morning everyone. \nHi, Emily. \nHello! \nMorning, Emily. \nGood morning. Maxim. \nGood morning everyone. \nToday we'll dive into the world of writing. \nSpecifically how to write emails. \nLet's imagine you want to email\nyour friend to make plans for the weekend. \nFirst, make a simple and clear subject for your email. \nLike \"Weekend Plans\", so they know what your email is about. \nBegin the email with a friendly \"Hi [Friend's Name],\" \nThen share your main message. \nDo you want to grab coffee this Saturday? \nKeep it short and clear and be polite. \nLet me know if that works for you. \nFinish with a nice closing, like \nLooking forward to it! \nBest regards, [Your Name]. \nRemember, simple, friendly, and clear is the way to go! \nNow, give it a try in the exercise. \nNeed any help with the exercise? \nYeah, Emily. \nI'm not confident in writing emails. \nCan you give me some tips? \nOf course, Maxim! Let's work on this together. \nIt's great that Maxim is seeking help. \nYou're right. He is nice! \nThat's great. \n"
