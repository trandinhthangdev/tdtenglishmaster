the Oak one oh it's made of birch sir but Oak is a \nbit better when it comes to lifespan gosh who cares the thing is the Birch \ntable looks better oh no Mike the question is is it long \nlasting and

camping at the Jim Corbett National Park \nthen we got home I found out that she had a pretty big rash and red spots all \nover her arms and legs she told me that they made her itchy and that she couldn't stand them \nI thought she just got normal mosquito bites and the rash would go away but it's been several days and the \nproblem is still there poor little girl well I think I have some suggestions here which may help her \nfeel better what are they well this type of cream can soothe the \nrash immediately but it doesn't work for serious skin rashes this is the daily treatment \napplying every day how about something which has stronger effects \nyes we have very efficient pills your daughter can take one every two days \nand if the rash gets worse I highly recommend you take her to the doctor oh I got it thank you so much for your \nhelp I'll take the pills [Music] \nHaircut \nhow much trimming do you want please \n[Music] hi how do you want your hair to be today

\ntomorrow oh hi it's you again coming back so soon \ndid you give it to him I'm actually here because I forgot my key and unfortunately no I didn't give \nit to him how so he didn't like my cupcakes not really there were like 15 other \npeople that also gave the exact same black forest to him [Music] \nLactosefree milk \nlactose free milk \n[Music] hi Welcome to our store again how may I \nhelp you yes I want to make a complaint oh man what did we do \nyou remember that yesterday I bought a box of milk here yes ma'am I remember very clearly did \nyou have any problem with our milk well I bought it because you said it was natural and safe to use \nso you didn't find it natural and safe when my son drank it he said it was too \nsweet do you know how you can put a child at risk by making something so sweet \nmy apologies ma'am it'd be useful if you could tell me specifically \nhow the sweetness of our product has severely impacted your kid nothing has happened to him but it was \ntoo sweet you must have put tons of sugar in it I want a refund \nma'am this product only contains two grams of natural sugar \nthen how did it taste so sweet I won't leave until I receive an explanation \nyou do realize it is the lactose-free milk right lactose-free milk always tastes sweeter \nthan regular milk wait really I thought they taste exactly the same \nno this product has added lactase which breaks lactose down into glucose \nand galactose which can make it taste sweeter than usual \noh okay I see well considering we are about to blame \nthis time I retract my complaint [Music] \nNearsighted or farsighted \nare you nearsighted or farsighted [Music] \nhello what kind of glasses or lenses are you looking for I'm not sure I did buy another pair of \nvery expensive lenses at another Opticians but they didn't seem to work \nI see good thing you've come to us now can you tell me some problems you're having with your eyes \nwell I've been unable to see things clearly lately I see so your eyes have always been good \nbefore well I used to be nearsighted a very long time ago but I had an eye surgery \nhow long ago was it to be precise it was about five years ago \nwell the truth is even with the most modern LASIK surgery you still have a \ncertain rate of read myopia yes I'm aware of this I just didn't expect it to be coming back so soon \nokay so let's do the visual Acuity test now [Music] \nokay look at this this is the smallest word we have can you see it \nyeah sure it's easy to see what you sure then what problems do you \nhave well I was hoping you would give me the answer and not vice versa \nwait a minute Mark are you nearsighted or farsighted well the last time it was nearsighted \nall right let's do a refraction eye exam let's look at this machine okay here we go \n[Music] \nMark you are farsighted now \nforeign lesson highlights vocabulary \ncount on somebody [Music] prominent \ngood things come in small packages \nput somebody something at risk \nree myopia visual Acuity test \nrefraction eye exam \ndo you have inkjars [Music] \nhello what are you looking for yes sir do you have ink jars \nyes we do we have an ink bottle with a fountain pen \nokay then I'd like one set of them yeah sure we have some samples \nlet's come over here and see which one you like I thought they were all the same \noh no they're highly different from one another so which one should I use \nare you new to Fountain bins yes it's also my first time buying one \nif you're new to fountain pens then you should go for a popular brand \nsure what are my options for fountain pens I suggest you try Pock \nfor bottled ink I suggest you go for diamond can I first have a look \nabsolutely just take your time wow this is quite heavy \nof course a fountain pen uses a metal nib to apply \na water-based ink to paper so it has to be heavy do you want to try \nriding with it sure I mean I have known how to write since I was six \nthis should be easy hey why isn't this working \nyeah listen using a fountain pen is quite different from a regular pen \nyou shouldn't hold it like that then how should I hold it \nyou should hold the pen so it makes a 50 degree angle with your riding surface \nlike this yeah exactly that's perfect you're doing it correctly \nthe ink is Flowing this is quite difficult to be honest \nyeah may I ask you a question is this compulsory at your school \nif it is too difficult you can just use a regular pen now it's not compulsory I just want to \nshow it off to my new classmates [Music] \nGround Beef \nI need about a pound of ground beef [Music] \nJosh you come by again do you want some ground beef I don't know I'm more of a steak person \nhow was the steak you bought here last week enjoyed it it tasted like heaven I liked it a lot \nthen just give the ground beef a chance I guarantee you're going to love it \nyeah but isn't ground beef generally made from the less tender and less \npopular Cuts would be that is just some nonsense stuff \nreally how so it is an incredibly nutrient dense food \nthat can provide you with healthy fats proteins and B vitamins \nI don't know I'm not very experimental with Foods besides how am I supposed to cook it \nyou have plenty of options I can name you 20 dishes to make \nokay tell me some beef tacos spaghetti or even lettuce \nwraps spaghetti sounds nice how do I do that \nyeah man my wife and I had this the other day and it tastes amazing \ngive me the details all you have to do is combine some \ntomatoes and ground beef and cook them together they will be delicious when served with \nnoodles really just that simple \nyes it is and I think for a single guy like you it is very convenient too \nwell then I think I need about a pound of ground beef right

horror \nthere are some if I'm not mistaken but I don't want to watch scary movies \nah right I forgot you're frightened of ghosts there's a comedy called hello Teddy Bear \nwhich is also very interesting want to give it a go I love comedy let's go \n[Music] \nthat was so hilarious right yeah I couldn't stop laughing because of \nthe funny plot exactly and the cast was also amazing \nI think most of them are newbies in the film industry but their facial expressions lived up to my expectations \nand I didn't expect there would be a plot twist in a comedy but there was \nI laughed so hard when the wife found out that her husband was betraying her behind her back all the time \nI know right I would definitely recommend that film to my friends \n[Music] travel planning \nhello Justin oh hi I'm good you \nI feel much better now that I hear your voice I wonder if I can come over to your \nplace now oh absolutely what time will you come \nin about five minutes because I'm

\nbeach in Malibu their Spa service is Top Notch and you can even join their free yoga and \nmeditation classes wow sounds interesting \nbut actually I would love to go on an adventure with you do you want to try to go snorkeling or \nsurfing instead wow I've never thought about them \nbut I think it's gonna be marvelous yeah and I also want to try some local \nseafood with you I know a seafood
