I'm concerned about the local \neducation system quality where what area do you \nmean I mean the area where we're moving to I've heard a lot of awful \nstuff as low test scores High Dropout rates \nand issues with discipline the school doesn't seem to care about the \nstudents hm that sounds bad I find the issue of Education there very \nalarming Jack's school here was excellent but what about his new \none we should pay more attention to this issue well I think \nso there is a good private school nearby a Catholic \nschool is it pricey not too expensive I know some of \nmy co-workers send their children there as well at the very least that is a better option \non Monday I'll phone them and inquire about registering Jack for next semester okay but think carefully about \nyour decision sure dialogue \n2 is your iels test okay how do you think you fared on the \nEls not so good maybe I only got a 6.5 if I want to get into Manchester \nUniversity I have to to get a \n7.5 is it that difficult almost no one ever gets a \n7.5 yes it's a really high score that is really difficult to attain so which university do you plan \nto attend I'm not certain perhaps I'll attend Guang dong

she still \nenrolled in college of course she's a good student her subjects all scored a and I \ncomplimented her on her intelligence well I think that schools train students very well particularly in \nterms of memorization that is why they excel in mathematics and \nscience yeah she is really fortunate because California citizens are entitled \nto free tuition I'm not sure how she'd Finance college with her part-time work at \nMcDonald's of course we know she's tenacious and resourceful she owes you a great deal \nfor assisting her in obtaining a visa to the United States I think she deserves it she tried \na lot 40 work dialogue \none you look a bit tired what's up nothing I'm at work right now are you \nreally okay actually I'm not very well work makes me very \nstressed why is that you know I've lost all respect since the firm declared \ntheir aim of sales I don't quite get it my sales last \nmonth did not meet the target so this month must meet the target oh I see I've

obsession in the past \nfor me I'd rather live a regular life now sorry to hear that but do you think \nyou could have achieved Fame if you had persisted I think possibly my friend \nBarry is an example he and I used to fantasize about taking over the literary \nworld he persisted and ultimately he was successful very famous in the literary \nworld I don't believe he was any more gifted than I was why did you quit up \nwhen he was successful I prefer to eat than write 45 \nmaking appointments dialogue 1 can we change the time from today to \ntomorrow at 10:00 sure no problem are you sure

traditional Chinese dress like this design can you do \nit do you mean a Kow right I want it to look like this \ndesign I like a black background with Red Dragons looks good this is a very \ntraditional design what is its price depending on the fabric you \nchoose silk is more expensive but it has more appealing appearance of course \npolyester is less expensive how many meters of fabric do I need for this \ndress this also depends on your height the length of the sleeves and the \nneckline I want the sleeve length to be 34 with slits along the \nsides I got it it will probably take about 2 m and you also need to buy a \nlining for it what about those beautiful tiny Fasteners on the \ndress oh in China those are referred to as buttons they are known as frogs in the \nUnited States dialogue three I really want to buy you the Plaid \nskirt no this design will make me appear overly chubby no way why you think that you're \nthin as a rail you'd blow away in the breeze if you were thinner in fact I believe a dark Hue \nwould be preferable it is the basic color and also easy to coordinate with other \ncolors the whole wardrobe is dark it looks boring ing I think you should lighten \nup okay perhaps you're correct I could wear a lighter Hue but not that plaid it \nappears to be overly childish it's the new trend in Autumn do you not read any fashion \nmagazines oh so do

dialogue 2 do you know someone who has \nundergone plastic surgery what do you mean like breast enlargement that isn't really essential \nin my opinion that is not how a lady should maintain her attractiveness what's the harm why can't \nwe have plastic surgery because I'm not sure but Connie \nyou wouldn't do anything like that would you you're absolutely correct correct \nI'd do it I think just using Cosmetics is enough instead of having plastic \nsurgery come on Liz keep an open mind I hope that surgery will help me get rid \nof my low self-esteem what will other people think of you
