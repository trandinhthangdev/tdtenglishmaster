after many difficulties you sit \ndown relax and enjoy the beautiful scenery from above \nwonderful isn't it yeah i can imagine but \ndon't you get bored sitting on a motorbike for so long you haven't tried riding a motorbike at \nhigh speed right no but why \nyou have to try it then you will get why i love that feeling \nlike my body merging with the bike \ni am afraid of going at high speed yes this type of drabble is only suitable \nfor adventurous people like me you must have had many memorable \nexperiences right yes in addition to the scenery experience \nwith the human there is even more valuable human experience do you mean culture \nyes but more specifically about humanity \nhumanity i don't get it many people helped me when i had an \naccident or a bike breakdown \nthose are the experiences i remember the most before i thought that backpackers like \nyou were mainly to satisfy their adventurous nature most of the people think so too \ntalking to you today is really mind opening do you want to try once \nyes after talking to you i also want to give it a try \nyeah i'll call you when i can arrange a suitable trip \nokay thank you nothing more companions more fun \n[Music] i have a problem with my laptop \nDaniel \n[Music] \nhello mrs lisa i call from tech electronics i'm daniel from customer \nservice hi daniel keep going yes recently you came to our store to \nfix some laptop errors did i call to ask how's your laptop \nnow is fine great would you have time for us to ask about your customer support and warranty \nservice experience at our store glad asked about my laptop \nthat is my pleasure last week i couldn't turn on my laptop \nat all the screen was black but i just bought it two months ago \ni'm so sorry to hear about it i called customer service and was transferred to the technical department \nbut the process is too long very waste of my time \ni have noted and we'll discuss with our team after that the screen froze right after \ni could turn on the laptop i called your hotline again and it was busy \nsincerely sorry to put you in this trouble i went to your store in anger but your \nstaff's attitude calmed me down this is our pleasure madam \nyou were kind and solved the problem so fast especially the i.t staff are really \ngood thank you for your compliment because my laptop was still in the \nwarranty period it was repaired completely free of charge from one to \nfive points how many points would you give us i think four it will be five points if your hotline \nworks faster thanks for your feedback it helps us to improve the quality of service for the \nnext time you need us you're welcome [Music] \nMom and Baby \nmom and baby health care service \ncould you recommend any mom and baby health care services which is the best \ni didn't hire any services my mother helped me she has a lot of experience \ni hired a service the company is mom's happiness baby's smile \nhow is that place i used the coming home service package i \nthink it's suitable for you too sounds convenient yeah after leaving the hospital they \narranged for a person to come and support me what does the package include \nthey visited the doctor with me during the first month telephone consultations with doctors \nsounds great they supported lactation nutrition and postnatal recovery their staff has a lot \nof knowledge about this anything else selena they talked and helped me relax \nif this person isn't suitable you can change for another do you hire them all day \nno i hired until 5 pm because i want to take care of my baby myself after \ntraining but if anything urgent you can call them give me their contact please \nof course but it's not really cheap it's okay once you have experience it's \nnot expensive
