we're right on schedule it's not like we have any other choice \nwe're all scared of a grumpy Alex if you guys had said anything I wouldn't \nhave been grumpy well we're all here now that's what matters \nthat's right look at all the foods Alex and Adam have prepared \nI bet we're gonna have a great time going camping one hour later \nvisit me or is the road quite small for tourists no I

talk about it right now we should repair the car as soon as possible \nI understand let me call the mechanic quickly please \n[Music] Tick Tock now we will take a few minutes \nto analyze some words in the conversation here is to receive or become conscious \nof a sound using our ears listen is to give attention to someone \nor something in order to understand and process what they're saying \nlook is to physically use your eyes or to direct your eyes to something in \nparticular or in a particular direction watch is to look at something or someone \nfor a particular period of time

much time \nforeign [Music] \nEnglish through real conversation in today's lesson we're going to learn how \nto write an effective email and the difference between formal and informal email let's learn common mistakes that \npeople generally make while writing an email and see probable Solutions \npart one formal email thank you \nNatalie please come to see me in my office in five minutes yes sir \n[Music] \nhi Richard did you want to see me take a seat I want to talk with you \n[Music] do you know how to write an email in the workplace \nis there something wrong you made a lot of mistakes in this email \nfirst look you didn't write the email subject line \nnever ever have a blank subject line how was your recipient supposed to know \nwhat your email is about if it doesn't have the specific line secondly the words you use in the email \nare completely inappropriate for the workplace environment you need to use formal words when \nwriting the email third you forgot to attach the document \nto the email it wasn't the first time you've made this mistake I don't want it to happen \nagain I'm so sorry I promise never to make the same mistakes again \nplus the person who has responded or is involved in the project needs to be cc'd \nor beccedied in the email finally no more spelling mistakes and \nremember there must be a signature in the email I got it sir I will keep that in mind \nand Natalie last time you didn't submit the report on time \nif you still make such mistakes you will be fired yes sir \n[Music] You Look so Sad Natalie what happened \nI got scolded by my boss because I made a lot of mistakes in my email \nif this situation keeps happening I'm afraid I won't finish the internship \nI don't know what I should do everyone makes mistakes when I first came to the company I also \ngot scolded by my boss [Music] but because of that I learned a lot \ndon't worry I will help you really you're so kind thank you very \nmuch don't mention it to write a professional email you need \nto pay attention to these things what are they before writing or sending an email you \nneed to have a professional email address this email address is one you use for \nwork so make sure to use it only for work related purposes or formal communication \nis it the email address the company gave me that's right for all the work related matters you \nneed to use that email address okay I got it every email needs to have a subject line \nyou need to write a concise informative subject line it is a short phrase that summarizes the \nreason for your email message for example can I write it like this revenue reports third quarter 2022. \nyou are learning fast thank you when you click reply all you must be \ncareful because that means you've emailed your response to both the sender of the \nprevious message and everyone who received the original email okay I'll keep this in mind \nyou also need to create your personal email signature do you know how to create one \nyes I do is there anything I need to pay special attention to \nit should include your full name job title a photo of yourself a direct phone \nnumber and a hyperlinked website address a professional signature allows you to \npromote your brand and Company oh I'm still missing the website address \nI will add it later when you write an email you should begin with an appropriate greeting \nslang overly friendly or overly stiff language must always be avoided \nI see if so I bet I can't use interjections or \nexclamation points either right that's right you should keep everything short simple \nand formal and if you write an email to foreign clients you should pay attention to \ncultural differences to avoid unnecessary problems such useful knowledge thank you for \ntelling me this no problem and last but not least you must always \ndouble check everything before sending it thank you Anna now I can write a proper \nand professional email to send to my boss I know you can do it keep at it I'm \nleaving see you later [Music] \npart two informal email \nwhat are you doing could you do me a favor just watching YouTube what do you need \nmy computer has just crashed and can't be used can you help me to write an \nemail for a friend sure Mom I just learned how to write an email today this is a great chance for me to \npractice what do you want me to write about I want to email my best friend from \nmiddle school she is living abroad now I haven't talked to her for a long time \nI want to know how she is doing that's it is there anything else you \nwant to write uh-huh I want her to know how about my current \nlife let her know that I still work as a teacher but now I have moved to our old \nschool help me to say that I miss her very much [Music] \nand I would like to invite her to come back here to visit my house so that we can reminisce about old memories \nno problem uh what is her name Susan \nokay I got it trust me \nall done what do you think let me take a look \nsubject informal email from your old friend Mary Dear Mrs Susan I'm writing to express my \nyearning for you it has been a long time since we last met would you mind telling me a little more \nabout your current life I would be grateful to know please reply at your earliest \nconvenience I look forward to hearing from you sincerely Mary Anderson \nmy goodness why did you write it so formally \nwhat's wrong with that Mom it looks like you're inviting a president over to my house \nwhy do you say that because it's too polite and formal not \nsuitable when talking to friends so what do I need to do \nthe email subject doesn't have to be that complicated just keep it simple \nbut I thought it was already simple you can write it shorter for example \nletter from Mary okay let me fix it anything else \nin the beginning you can use a friendly greeting such as hi Susan \nit's so simple this is not a work context so you can \nwrite it informally comfortable ah so that's it \nyou should notice a few more points after the greeting you can express my \napology for a long time without contact then the reason for writing the email \nand finally is the invitation at the end of the letter use a cordial \ngreeting that makes sense I know my problems thank you Mom \nwriting emails is so hard but I'm glad I learned a new style of email writing \nthink and speak in
