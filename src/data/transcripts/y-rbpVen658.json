see yourself right now we're planning to get married \ncongratulations [Music] thanks how about you and Stacy \nwe still love each other like the first day but Stacy is a little different from \nwhat I thought what do you mean she is very smart \nso I mean like she can read my mind \nI can't hide anything from her relief \nStacy often helps me with complex problems that I can't figure out how to \nsolve \nwhen we argue I'm usually the loser \nI once tried to lie to Stacy to go out what did you do \nI texted I'm afraid I'll be home late tonight \nwhat did she reply I have no chance to lie about the reason \n[Music] honey I'm afraid I'll be home late tonight \n[Music] are you going to say that your boss told you to work overtime \nor is it that Zach and his girlfriend had an argument and he needs you right \nnow [Music] or is your car broken down \nactually I'll be home soon [Music] \nshe reads you like a book yes and there was one thing that makes me \nboth love and respect Stacy what was that \nStacy was then a new employee at a company \nforeign do you understand what I said \nyes I do as a new employee don't think you're \nbetter than anyone else my words are orders the staff just needs \nto listen and follow keep it in mind \nI still have a lot to learn I would like to see this report well \ndone on my desk in three days I understand [Music] \ntwo days later \nI finished the report you gave me please take a look \nshe did it really well and did it so quickly maybe I can use her to do many things \nfor me I think this report is not fine at all \nwrong layout font size is not uniform and the content is too wordy \ntry again with this it is easier just enough for your \nability thank you [Music] \nwhat have you reached the important part yet calm down \nthe best part is in the end okay \nStacy did a great job so Barbara assigned more and more work \nto Stacy gradually Barbara assigned almost all \nher work to Stacy while Stacy had to do all of Barbara's \nwork Barbara just sat there and did nothing that's excessive that girl is so bossy \nwhy did Stacy have to suffer like this [Music] \nreport is very good you have researched the market thoroughly \nyou've been doing great lately Barbara thank you sir what methods did you use \nto improve your work or did someone else assist you in doing all of this \nI have found new methods of market research

methods to train employees to be more productive \nI will sir we have a big project coming up with a \nspecial business partner do you know Tony Pearson \nI know him well he is well known in our

this project to \nsomeone as talented as you Barbara if you do well I will promote you \nyes sir I will do my best you can trust me \n[Music] \nyesterday I overheard a conversation between Barbara and Harold \nhe must have complimented Barbara a lot yes and she took all the credit for \nherself that's excessive she is ridiculous \nI can't believe it Stacy did those things and she took all \nthe credit for herself don't worry about it I'm just doing my duty \nnothing to do huh do you know it's business hours now \nall of you will work overtime today and Stacy meet me in my room \nyour work attitude is good Stacy not like the others \nwhatever I have a new project take a look [Music] \nit's not like previous projects it's not important at all it's a small \nproject I think I need more
