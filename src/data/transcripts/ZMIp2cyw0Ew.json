\nyou can play it again repeatedly while \nengaging in other activities to help \nyour brain memorize the language \nbe patient and you will swiftly improve \nyour speaking and listening skills \nnow let's jump right into the video \ndon't say this to speak like a native \nEnglish speaker \nif you want to make your English more \nnatural please pay close attention to \ntoday's video because we're going to \ntell you five phrases that English \nLearners often use but native English \nspeakers wouldn't say because they're \nincorrect or because they just don't \nsound natural \nsituation one \nSituation 1 \n[Music] \nif Andrew comes in here and asks where I \nam please say you don't know \nwhy \nplease just say you don't know \nokay \n[Music] \ndo you know where Milton is \nno I don't know \nyou're lying you know where he is \nI don't know nothing \nyou've made a mistake \nI don't know nothing \nin this sentence you have a double \nnegative \na double negative makes a positive it \nmeans I know everything \nso I don't know nothing equals I know \neverything \nyou should use I don't know anything \nI get it thank you Jessica \nyou mean you know everything \nI mean I don't know anything \nokay \nwhy are you looking for him \nhe broke my computer screen \nwhat happened \nhe just bought a new baseball bat he \nswung his Bat in my room \noh \nI warned him that it would break \nsomething in my room \njust what I thought he accidentally \nbroke my computer screen then he ran \naway \nso that's what happened \nwell I don't know where he is \n[Music] \noh okay I'll look for him somewhere else \n[Music] \nsituation too \nSituation 2 \n[Music] \nstill remember Matthew \nof course \nhe was a nerd and didn't talk much \nyeah \nand do you still remember Rose \nof course she was a beautiful and \npopular girl in our school at that time \nright Matthew and Rosa married \nreally \nRose is married with Matthew \nhold on \nRose is married with Matthew let's check \nwhy that sentence is wrong \nwith is often used for being together or \ninteracting together \nexamples we stay with them \nhowever when talking about two people \nwho are married we don't say married \nwith \nsay Rose is married to Matthew \nthanks again Jessica \nwhat did you say \nRose is married to Matthew \nyes \nhow did she fall in love with him \nI heard he changed after graduation \nchanged \nyes \nhe looks like an elegant and attractive \ngentleman now \nwho said that \nLinda she is his colleague \nwho's Linda \nshe is my girlfriend \ndoes your girlfriend ever say you look \nlike a gentleman

Keith \nwho's that \nit's Aurora \noh what's the problem \nI'll pick up her from the airport \npick up her is it correct \nwhen the phrasal verb has an object if \nwe use the object's name then we can say \nit in two ways \nI'll pick Aurora up I'll pick up Aurora \nhowever if we use a pronoun then the \npronoun must go in the middle of the \nphrasal verb \nso don't say I'll pick up her say I'll \npick her up \nyou're amazing Jessica \nI'll pick her up from the airport \nwhy doesn't she take a taxi \nbecause of rush hour it's difficult to \ncatch a taxi \non the way back please buy me a

really \nhere \nawesome \ndo you want to play a match with me \nin just five minutes \nwhy not now \nwhat is this private Journal \nhey stop watching my private Journal \nyou know the difference between watch \nlook and see \nI'm not sure \nthey're often confused in meaning \nhowever they should be used in different \nsituations \nlook means to look at something directly \nwith intention \nmeans to see things that come into our \nsight naturally \nwatch means to look at something in a \nperiod of time usually it's something \nthat's moving or changing \nso we can see something even if we don't \nwant to but we can only look at \nsomething on purpose \nthis is how you should say it stop \nlooking at my private Journal \nstop looking at my private Journal \nwhy did you say anything bad about me in \nthere \nyes a lot \ndo you know why it is called a private \nJournal \nwhy \nbecause it's private not public you \ncan't read it unless it's yours \nand this is my private Journal so

\nfast food \nyeah \nI don't like fast food \nme too \nwait a minute Keith \nyou are not sure what to use when \nagreeing with a positive or A negative \nstatement \nwe use two for a positive statement \nexample \nI know him \nme too \nand for a negative statement we should \nuse neither \nexample I didn't do that me neither \nso when Milton says I don't like fast \nfood you can say me
