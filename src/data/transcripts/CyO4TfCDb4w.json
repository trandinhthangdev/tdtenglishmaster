    "transcript": "[Music] I think it's going to rain \nlater Carlos great to see you I've got all the picnic stuff set up over here \nhey Mia everything looks perfect but I think it's going to rain \nlater did you check the weather forecast oh I did this morning and it \nwas clear but you're right those clouds do look ominous I always trust my instincts when \nit comes to weather my grandma used to say that if the birds fly low expect rain and a \nshow that's a neat saying well if it does s terrain we can always move to that gazebo over \nthere good idea for now let's enjoy the sandwiches and the fresh \nair by the way what's in this sandwich smells amazing it's a surprise but I'll give \nyou a hint it's a Mediterranean classic F I'm \nintrigued well let's eat up before those clouds decide to shower [Music] \nus throw in the \ntowel Lily you looked pretty frustrated during that last set everything okay \nyeah it's just this routine feels so tough I was almost ready to throw in the towel today \nthrow in the towel what do you mean oh it's an idiom it means I was \nthinking of giving up because it was too hard gotcha you know everyone has those \ndays or from what I've seen you're making good progress thanks \nNoah it just feels feels like I hit a wall sometimes and I can't move past it that's natural remember why you \nstarted this journey it's okay to feel down but don't let that be the reason to \nquit you're right I appreciate the pep talk I'll keep pushing forward that's the \nspirit if you ever need a workout buddy or some motivation you know where to find me thanks Noah let's crush it \ntogether next time \nTom didn't tell us how big your house \nwas wow Alex this place is massive Tom didn't tell us how big your \nhouse was thanks Olivia it's been in the family for years \nwe're quite attached to it it's like something out of a magazine architect the art everything is \nso detailed I did mention it was impressive but I guess I didn't emphasize the size \nI've always loved this place appreciate the kind words it can be a bit much to \nmaintain but we've made so many memories here I can imagine with a house this big \nyou could host some epic parties we've had our fair share speaking of which how about a mini \ntour before dinner I'd love that especially if there are any secret rooms or \npassages ah always The Adventurous one Ethan I'm in two Let's Get The Grand \nTour Alex all right follow me let the adventures \nbegin we already know the \ntruth Jake we need to talk about what happened at the party last weekend oh uh \nwhat about it look Jake we already know the truth there's no point in trying to hide it \nanymore I I didn't know how to tell you both I didn't want to upset \nanyone it's always better to be upfront about things Secrets only make matters \nworse we're your friends Jake we would have understood I'm really sorry I didn't \nthink breaking that vase was a big deal but I should have owned up to it it was a gift from my grandma it had \nsentimental value the important thing now is to find a way to make a \nmens Jake I believe you didn't mean any harm I promise I'll try to find a \nsimilar vase or somehow compensate for Emma it's not about the vase Jake it's \nabout trust just promise us no more secrets I promise and I'm truly \nsorry she raised her hand to ask a \nquestion Bella did you notice the new girl Zoe during the lecture yeah she raised her hand to ask \na question right she seemed really smart exactly her question was really \ninsightful I had never thought about the topic in that way before me neither it's always refreshing \nto have New Perspectives in class do you know where she's from I think she mentioned during the \nintroduction that she's from Australia Ah that's cool International \nstudents often bring such unique viewpoints we should probably introduce ourselves after \nclass I was thinking the same it's always good to make new friends especially if they're as \ninteresting as Zoe seems to be definitely plus forming study groups \nwith diverse members always helps in understanding the subject better agreed let's approach her \ntogether after the lecture I'm sure she'd appreciate some friendly faces sounds like a plan Aiden let's do \nit have you ever seen a [Music] \ntsunami this document is so intense have you ever seen a tsunami \nMaya no and I hope I never do it's one of those forces of nature that truly \nterrifies me how about you no what I've read a lot about them \nthe sheer power and destruction they can bring is mindboggling yeah and it's so tragic how \nthey often strike with little to no warning so many lives lost than an \ninstant that's why there's a push for more advanced early Warning Systems especially in areas prone to \ntsunamis true technology can be a real Lifesaver in these \nsituations but still it's always good to know the signs and be prepared just in \ncase absolutely like the receding of the tide if you see the water pull away from \nthe shore Suddenly It's a warning sign he I've also heard that sometimes \nthere's a loud roaring sound almost like a train it's chilling \nto think about it is Nature's power is all inspiring and \nhumbling but on a lighter note I'm grateful we're here just enjoying a peaceful day me too Leo always good to \nbe reminded of the beauty and calm of nature as \nwell did you sleep well last [Music] \nnight hey Casey good morning did you sleep well last night morning Alex \nactually not really I stayed up late watching a movie and now I regret it how about \nyou oh I can relate but for me it was because my neighbors were having a loud \nparty until 2: a.m. I hardly got any sleep oh no that's frustrating have you \never talked to them about the noise I have a couple of times they're \nusually considerate but last night was an exception anyway how was the \nmovie it was great I watched the midnight sky ever heard of it oh yeah \nthat's the one with George Clooney right I've been meaning to watch it yep that's the one it's a bit slow paced but the \nstory is really touching I definitely recommend it if you're into drama and \nsci-fi I'll keep that in mind hopefully on a night when I don't have an early meeting the next \nday speaking of which I should head out soon got it we should grab coffee again \nsoon maybe next time on a day when we've both had better sleep \ndefinitely take care Casey you too Alex and try to get some \nrest [Music] \ntonight my favorite color is [Music] \nblue look at that kite Ethan my favorite color is blue just like that one up \nthere oh I can see why it's such a calming and beautiful shade of blue \nalmost like the sky exactly blue has always been special \nto me it reminds me of the ocean and clear skies what's your favorite \ncolor I've always been fond of green it's the color of nature growth \nand Harmony plus it reminds me of our hiking trips that makes \nsense and when you think about it blue and green together create such a Serene image \nthe sky meeting the trees absolutely they compliment each \nother perfectly just like us H that's a sweet way to put it \nspeaking of colors should we get some paint for our art project next week \ngreat idea I think a blend of our favorite colors would make our project Stand Out agreed let's head to the art \nstore after this and pick out the best shades of blue and green s sounds like a plan \n[Music] Mia how was your \n[Music] weekend Hey Taylor long time no see how \nwas your weekend hi Jamie oh it was quite \nadventurous I went hiking up in the mountains and you that sounds exciting my weekend was \nmore laidback I just visited my grandparents in the countryside that's lovely there's always \nsomething comforting about visiting family how are they doing they're good thanks for \nasking they always have a ton of stories to share it's like a trip down memory \nlane every time I visit I can imagine by the way have you tried the \nnew Cafe downtown I went there after my hike and the pastries were to die \nfor no but I've heard about it I'm a sucker for good \npastries maybe we could check it out together next weekend sounds like a plan I'd love to \nlet's make it a date perfect I'll text you the details later \nthis week great looking forward to it have a good run \njie thanks Taylor you \ntoo bite the \n[Music] bullet hey Riley you seem a bit stressed \nwhat's up oh hey Sam it's just these upcoming exams I'm not feeling prepared \nat all I get that but sometimes you just have to bite the bullet and give it your \nbest shot bite the bullet what does that mean it's an idiom it means means to \nface a difficult situation with courage even if you don't want to oh I see I guess you're right I've \nbeen putting off studying because I'm scared of how much I don't know it's natural to feel that way or \nremember the more you avoid it the harder it gets better to tackle it head on \nnow thanks Sam I needed that I'll start with the subjects I find hardest first \nthat's the spirit if you need any help or want to study together just let me know I \nappreciate that let's get through this [Music] \ntogether what's the weather like [Music] \noutside hey Sam you just came in what's the weather like outside it's surprisingly chilly for \nthis time of the year and there's a light drizzle I think Autumn is coming \nearly oh I love the Autumn season the colors the crisp air \nEverything feels so refreshing true but I wasn't prepared for it \ntoday left my umbrella and jacket at home classic me oh Sam always forgetful but don't \nworry we'll stay here until the rain stops this Cafe is so cozy \nanyway that sounds perfect I've always loved the warmth of this place especially when it's cold \noutside and their hot chocolate is to die for speaking of which should we order \nsome it's the perfect weather for it absolutely let's indulge here's to unexpected weather and \ndelightful company cheers to [Music] \nthat I'm feeling a a bit tired \ntoday Jake I'm feeling a bit tired today I think the new project is taking \na toll on me I get that it's been a hectic week for all of us have you been getting \nenough sleep not really I've been staying up late to catch up on \nwork plus my neighbor's dog has been so noisy lately oh that's tough maybe you could \nuse some earplugs they've been a lifesaver for me during noisy \nnights that's a good idea I might give them a try and maybe I should also start \nsetting a strict bedtime definitely sleep is crucial especially with the kind of workload we \nhave and don't hesitate to ask for help if you need it we're a team after \nall thanks Jake that means a lot I'll keep that in mind how about you how have \nyou been managing I've Had My Moments but regular breaks and short walks have been \nhelpful plus meditation before sleep does wonders I've heard about that maybe I \nshould give meditation a try anything for a good night's sleep absolutely remember it's all about \nfinding what works for you and sticking to \nit burn the Midnight \nOil Alex have you been burning the midnight oil lately I've seen you here late every \nnight this week oh yes these exams have me working around the \nclock I just want to be well prepared how about you I've had a few late nights \nmyself but I'm trying to balance my study schedule so I don't exhaust myself \nthat's smart I've been feeling the strain especially this morning my eyes were so \nheavy it's important to give yourself breaks Alex burning the midnight oil is \nfine occasionally but consistent sleep deprivation isn't good for you you're right I need to find a better \nRhythm maybe take short naps or switch to a more reasonable study schedule definitely and remember quality \nover quantity it's about how efficiently you study not just the number of \nhours true thanks Nora I needed to hear that how about we take a break now grab \nsome coffee sounds perfect let's recharge and get back to it with fresh \nMinds agreed a balanced approach is the way to \ngo my cat knocked over the vase yesterday \nDaniel my cat knocked over the vase yesterday I can't believe the Mischief \nshe gets into oh no was it an expensive V thankfully not but it was a gift from \nmy grandmother more sentimental value you know that's unfortunate cats can be so \ncurious sometimes they love exploring every nook and cranny tell me about it \nI'm thinking of buying some toys to distract her from such Adventures any \nrecommendations for sure how about a cat tower or a scratching post they love climbing and \nit might keep her away from the delicate items that sounds like a good idea maybe \nI'll also get some interactive toys keep her occupied you know absolutely toys that stimulate \ntheir hunting instincts work great like laser pointers or feather \nones perfect thanks Daniel I'll pick some up hopefully my other VES will now \nbe safe fingers crossed and if all else fails maybe a slight rearrangement at \nhome keep the breakables out of her [Music] \nreach we're out of milk can you pick some [Music] \nup Sam we're out of milk can you pick some up on your way back from the \ngym sure no problem do we need anything else bread eggs maybe some \nfruit oh good thinking yes grab some bananas and oranges too if you can we're running low \non those got it bananas oranges and milk \nanything else maybe some cereal the kids love the Honey Nut \none all right I'll pick that up too by the way there's a new store that \nopened nearby they have fresh organic produce want me to check it out oh yes I \nheard about it see if they have any fresh berries the kids love them in their \nyogurt berries noted I'll take a look and let you know what I find thanks Sam oh and don't forget the \nmilk it's the main thing don't worry it's a at the top of my \n[Music] list the ball is in your \ncourt Jack I've done my part of the presentation and shared all the data with you now the ball is in your \ncourt thanks Mia I appreciate all the hard work you've put into this I'll \nfinalize the proposal and present it to the board next week perfect do you need any additional input \nfrom my side or perhaps a run through before the final presentation a run through sounds great \nlet's schedule one for Friday we can iron out any kinks then \nagreed I want to make sure we're both on the same page this project is crucial \nfor our team absolutely we've got one shot to impress the board and thanks for giving \nme the lead on this I'll make sure to bring it home I trust you Jack and remember Teamwork Makes the Dream Work \ncouldn't agree more I'll draft the final slides and get back to you by Thursday \nlatest perfect I'll await your update thanks Mia with our combined \nefforts I'm sure we'll Ace \nthis he's in debt to the bank because he bought that big house \nRyan did you hear about Jake he's in debt to the bank because he bought that big house on Elm \nStreet seriously that house is huge I wonder why he made such a \nmove he was always talking about living within his means I know right but he mentioned that \nit was a good investment opportunity and the property rates are bound to go up a few \nyears that may be true but property Investments can be risky especially if \nit's causing Financial strain right now exactly Sarah told me he's taken on two \njobs just to keep up with the mortgage payments it sounds so \nstressful wow that's tough I hope he's able to manage but sometimes we get carried away \nby dreams without assessing the reality of the situation so true and it's not just \nabout the money owning such a big house comes with its own set of responsibilities and \nmaintenance absolutely well I hope things turn around for him soon we \nshould check in on him maybe offer some help or support agreed we'll invite him over for \ndinner next week it's the least we can do sounds like a plan we're all friends \nafter all and we need to have each other's [Music] backs \nwhat you said was quite \ntrue Raj remember last month when you told me to focus on self-care and not to \nstretch myself too thin with work yeah I do I was just worried about \nyou seeing you so stressed and overworked well I took a week off spent \ntime reading and took some long walks in nature and honestly what you said was \nquite true I feel so much better now and I'm more productive than \nbefore let great to hear Lara sometimes we need to take a step \nback and recharge to move forward effectively I used to think that constant hustle was the only way but now \nI've realized the importance of balance in life it's a lesson we all learn at \nsome point and I'm glad you found your balance you deserve all the peace and \nhappiness in the world thanks Raj your advice was like a wakeup call I'm thinking of taking short \nbreaks more often maybe even try meditation meditation is a game changer \nI've been doing it for a year now and it really helps with Clarity and focus I can show you some beginner \ntechniques if you'd like that sounds wonderful I'd love to learn from you \nit's funny how sometimes a simple conversation can lead to such positive changes \nabsolutely conversations connections and genuine care for each other make the \nworld a better [Music] \nplace do you guys have any big plans [Music] \ntonight hey Ben Claire do you guys have any big plans tonight \nnot really I was thinking of ordering some pizza and binge watching a new series need some downtime after this \nhectic week that sounds so relaxing Ben I on the other hand have planned a \ndinner out with some college friends it's been ages since we all met \nup oh that sounds fun Claire I'm actually torn between going to a live concert downtown or just \ntaking it easy at home which band is playing tonight it's the sound waves I've heard \nthey're really good live but then my CCH is also quite \ntempting why not do both go to the concert tonight and then have a lazy Sunday at home \ntomorrow that's a balanced plan Claire Amy I'd say go for it the sound waves \nhave a great reputation for their life performances you guys might be right \nokay I'll book the tickets thanks for the push anytime and Ben enjoy your pizza and \nseries [Music] \nnight have you seen my glasses \nanywhere oh I can't find my glasses Jordan have you seen my glasses \nanywhere oh didn't you leave them on the coffee table last night I thought I did \nbut they're not there now hm did you check the kitchen sometimes you leave them there \nwhen you're having coffee in the morning no look and without them everything's a blur it's so \nfrustrating don't worry we'll find them think back where's the last place you \nremember having them I remember reading a book in the studio room but I already looked \nthere let's retre your steps after reading did you go to the balcony yes I went there to water the \nplants let me check \nthere aha found them they were stuck between the sofa cushions in the living \nroom oh relief thanks Jordan I need to be more mindful of \nwhere I put things happens to the best of us maybe consider getting one of those glasses \nchains to keep them around your neck \nI think I left my keys in the [Music] \nkitchen Chris I can't find my keys anywhere I think I left them in the \nkitchen did you check on the counter that's where you usually drop them I \njust glanced there but let me have a closer look while you're at it maybe check in the fridge too you have a habit \nof absent-mindedly placing things inside oh come on I did that \nonce twice actually last week it was your phone all right all right checking and \nnope not in the fridge or on the counter what about the drawer next to \nthe oven you sometimes keep them there when you're cooking found them they were in the \ndrawer I really need a dedicated spot for these Keys how about a key hook \nright by the door that way you can hang them up as soon as you come in that's a brilliant idea \nChris thanks for always having my back always now let's head out before \nwe're \nlate don't cry over spilled [Music] \nmilk oh no I'm so sorry Max I can't believe I did \nthat hey it's okay accidents happen luckily my laptop wasn't there \nbut your papers and your notes I feel terrible look don't cry over spilled \nmilk it's just some notes I can rewrite them are you sure I can help you with \nthem it's fine really thanks for offering though I'll be more careful \nnext time I just need to pay attention to my surroundings we all have our clumsy moments just \nremember to breathe and slow down a bit thank you Max for understanding I \npromise to make it up to you no need to let's just clean this up and move on and \nhey maybe we can invest in some spillproof cups for the break \nroom what time does the store close \nHey Taylor I need to pick up some stuff from the store nearby what time does the store \nclose if you're talking about the electronic store it closes at 900 p.m. but if you mean the grocery store \nit closes at 10 p.m. it's the electronic store good we have plenty of time then perfect do you \nknow what you're getting yeah I need some new headphones my old ones just \nbroke oh I've been thinking about getting a pair too maybe we can check if there are any \ndeals sounds like a plan absolutely and while we're out \nmaybe we can stop by the grocery store too we're out of snacks for movie night \ngood idea let's make it a productive \nevening I think I've caught a \ncold H I think I've got a cold I've been sneezing all morning and \nmy throat feels scratchy oh no that's not good have you \ntaken any medicine not yet I might head to the pharmacy during my lunch break you \nshould definitely do that and maybe consider working from home tomorrow just \nto be safe I was thinking the same I don't want to spread it around the \noffice that's thoughtful of you you make sure to get plenty of rest and drink lots of \nfluids I will thanks for the advice Jordan no problem and if you need any \nhelp covering your tasks while you're out just let me know I appreciate that \nhopefully it's just a 24hour thing and I'll be back at no \ntime jump on the \nbandwagon have you noticed how everyone's suddenly into rollerblading these days oh totally \nit's like they've all decided to jump on the bandwagon exactly just last month no one even \nmentioned it and now look \naround it's funny how Trends work one minute something's outdated and the next \neveryone's doing it so are you thinking of jumping on the band wagon too maybe it does look fun and it's good \nexercise what about you I used to rollerblade as a kid might pick it up \nagain but not just because it's trendy that's the spirit do it because \nyou enjoy it not because everyone else is doing \nit these dancers are like [Music] \nfamily you seem a bit nervous Leo everything all \nright just the usual Jitters but when I look around and see everyone here it's comforting these \ndancers are like family I know what you mean we've been through so much together rehearsals \ntours injuries and celebrations absolutely remember that \ntime the music stopped mid performance and we all just improvised how could I forget that was \nepic it's moments like that which really Bond us together couldn't agree more having a \nsupportive dance family makes the challeng is worth it so true let's give our best tonight \nand for each other and for the audience always let's do \n[Music] this I need to clean my \nroom ug I've been procrastinating all week I \nneed to clean my room tell me about it I always find some excuse not to do it do you need \nhelp would you that'd be amazing but only if you promise not to \nlaugh at my mess deal but you have to help me clean my place next weekend sounds \nfair we can turn it into a clean cleaning party music snacks and \nall I'm in cleaning is so much better with company plus I bet we'll find some \nforgotten Treasures in our mess oh for sure last time I found a \npair of earrings I thought I had lost forever see there's always a silver \nlining let's tackle that mess [Music] \ntogether shape up or ship out \nour project performance is really not meeting the expectations Robert the team \nneeds to shape up or ship out I understand the concerns Jessica it's \nhigh time we pulled our socks up do you think a team building exercise would help it might but everyone needs to \nunderstand the gravity of the situation we are all accountable for our \nresponsibilities absolutely let's ensure everyone understands their \nroles and the quality expected we could maybe set clear goals for the \nteam that sounds like a step in the right direction clear goals and regular \ncheck-ins could indeed drive better performance and maybe we can also have an open Forum where team members can \ndiscuss their concerns or suggestions for improvement great \nidea encouraging open dialogue can certainly help in identifying and addressing any issues hampering our \nperformance let's work together to get the team back on track agreed let's \nshape up and deliver an outstanding [Music]
