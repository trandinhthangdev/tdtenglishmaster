\nseries and reality shows I feel they are not only useful but also \nentertaining how about you do you have any favorite shows \nyes Who Wants To Be A Millionaire is one of my favorite TV shows ever \nwhat is it about as far as I can remember it was originally a UK TV game show \nthis was a kind of a quiz show in which contestants have to go through a set of 15 questions with increasing difficulty \nsounds interesting you should watch it sometime sure \n[Music] the best day of my life \nThe Best Day of My Life \n[Music] what was your best day at work \nI remember those days when I was a novice lecturer I really considered the feedback from the students \nwhat happened then after the first semester I got 80 percent positive feedback from all four \nsections wow the students seem to like you a lot \nmaybe so that day my head of Department called me to congratulate me that I did a great \njob you must be very happy yes I got a past percentage of 93 in the \nsubject I taught which was 57 earlier [Music] really that's great \nyes that was an achievement for me the day I received positive feedback \nfrom my students is the best day at my workplace \nnumber four introverts versus extroverts \nIntroverts vs Extroverts \nhey nice to see you here hi long time no see \nhow are you doing it's all good how about you I'm doing amazing \nyou're finally outside and around people it's a miracle what are you doing right now \nI want to find a book you have to come out more and have fun sometimes you know \nyeah maybe I enjoy spending time alone what do you do when you spend all that \ntime alone anyway I read watch TV play with my pet and \nlisten to music a lot of things do you want to go see a movie with us now \nhmm sure I guess great let's go [Music] \nMother\u2019s Day

bit addicted to social media why do you think so \nI found out that I spend a lot of time on social media every day how much time do you usually spend \nhow about four or five hours a day do you feel that time is useful to you \nmaybe not why are you asking because I also use social media a lot \nreally yes but I use it for my work purposes it \nhelps me with lots of tasks otherwise I wouldn't use it why is that \nbecause social media gets people distracted with nonsense I see I'm wasting my time \nmaybe I should rethink how I use social media social media isn't that bad it's just \nhow you use it you are right I got it [Music] \nlose weight [Music] \nLose weight \nwow you look so stunning are you losing weight \nyes last year I gained too much weight and it made me so depressed \nI became less confident about myself I didn't even want to face people \nI was afraid of comments about my weight oh I'm so sorry I didn't know that \nthat's okay the problem was me so I decided to change how did you do it \ninstead of having bread for lunch or dinner I ate soup vegetables fruit Etc \none day I thought of doing exercises so I started walking for an hour every day \nyou are very determined so how much weight did you lose 24 pounds in six months \nand my parents were also surprised after seeing me wow congratulations you look much more \nconfident thank you I realize that we can lose weight anytime \njust be patient and never give up [Music] \nscholarship \nScholarship \nI didn't get a scholarship this semester why is that I remember your grades were \npretty good yes my grades qualify for the scholarship but my training points are \nnot enough poor you then you should take part in more activities \nmy training points are very high but my study grades are never good enough if only we could share with each other I \ndon't like participating in those kinds of activities Matthew you get a scholarship every \nsemester how do you do it to increase your study grades you can earn extra credit points while you learn \nmaking high midterm grades will help you a lot for training points you need to \nparticipate in activities with high scores on weekends such as volunteering \nand arts oh so that's it thank you let me give it a try \n[Music] \nheavy rain \nHeavy rain \ndo you like heavy rain no I hate bad weather \nhow come because I wear glasses in light rain it wouldn't bother me much \nbut in heavy rain even an umbrella won't make much of a difference oh I see \nwearing glasses is indeed a bit inconvenient when the weather is bad \nyes especially I remember one time I took a short walk in Copenhagen \nalthough I had a large umbrella after walking about three blocks back from dinner \nI was totally soaked by the time I reached my hotel \nsorry to hear that how about you you seem to like the rain \na lot yes I love it more than just the feeling of breathing \nin the fresh air after the sky is washed I also love the smell of it \nwhat's interesting about its
