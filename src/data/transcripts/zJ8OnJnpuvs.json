\nhey Chris what exactly are you looking for I'm looking for remote control I \ndon't see it anywhere DV remote no I'm referring to the DVD \nplayer is it absolutely necessary yeah if I need to pause the \nmovie or change to a different scene have you looked for it everywhere is it trapped in the \ncouch I looked for it there how long has it been since you last saw it I was \nwatching the news this morning I was using it to switch channels H so where could it be I also \nwonder where it is oh here in the midst of a heap of \nnewspapers oh well I'm curious how it got there I don't know anyway thanks for \nfinding it what would you do if you didn't have me \ndialogue 2 fortunately my roommate moved to another \napartment why did you say that she was always utilizing my items without my \npermission she arbitrarily used my ruler paper stapler tape and other \nsupplies did you remind her no I have not you know it might be \ntough to mention these topics with friends or roommates at times you should \nhave probably stated the ground rules first you wouldn't have been so irritated if she hadn't utilized your \nbelongings yes I will notify my roommate not to use my belongings without my consent the next time or even better I \nwon't have a roommate that would save a lot of time and effort live and learn as they \nsay maybe you're right 49 politics \ndialogue one who are you going to vote for that \nis a secret I don't think I need to tell you really but I can tell you I voted \nfor Hollands Hollands why he's such an \nidiot oh so you must have voted for Roberts sure I did he is a very serious \nplans for actual transformation and how do you suppose he'll perform all that he's \ntold there's a budget surplus the government has extra money it's not \nenough for all his schemes he attends to boost taxes I'm willing to spend a bit more if \nit means a better quality of life for all of us pay more taxes I don't want \nto why although Holland stated that he would not raise taxes this does not make him a good \npresident as a result he is a a lowcost president he'd let me spend my money as \nI wanted instead of paying more taxes why don't you agree to pile more \ntaxes obviously not they didn't earn it I did so I want to spend on what I \nwant what about those less fortunate than us are you going to take care of \nthem I suppose so if individuals like you aren't willing to do it do you \nbelieve you have all the answers at the very least I'm considering the \nquestions dialog [Music] \n2 I'm sure you're relieved your time on the city council is \ndone yeah it's really a lot of pressure and sometimes it was a headache why do you say that you can \nsatisfy some of the people all the time and all of the people some of the time \nAbraham Lincoln observed but you can't satisfy all the people all the time that \nquote I believe is incorrect I believe it was fool the people rather than pleasing the people you know there was \nno way you could please everyone all the time that's quite typical someone will always object to something no matter \nwhat you say or do I'm not sure why people like politics so much it always \nmakes them trust it's worth getting into politics and I was just elected to the \ncity council consider working in state or federal government well I must say that I \nappreciate your behavior if only more people were like you it would be \nworthwhile 50 media dialogue 1 \n[Applause] what are you now \nreading oh I see there's a topic in the paper I'm not sure whether I agree with the author what is the article \nabout I believe his political viewpoints are skewed everyone has their own \nopinion I think the journalist should not put his personal opinion in the article except for an editorial \nstory oh my each newspaper has its own style some papers are liberal While \nothers are conservative I know but this author appears to be prejudiced toward the \npresident and you don't agree honestly his point is very \nconvincing simply consider what he says will you remember it I'm still trying to \ndo that it is beneficial to read stuff with which you disagree it helps to keep \nyour mind sharp yeah this newspaper makes me unable to refute because my theoretical \npoint is too sketchy see that is true for everyone and it is \nwonderful to recognize that just wait till I read another Tale in favor of the \npresident dialogue [Applause] \n2 I don't believe the station does a good job of covering the news I don't agree being a news director \nmust be a demanding job so what is it difficulty they must pick which news is \nthe most significant or what to start with this is what draws viewers in that shouldn't be that difficult it \nis just what is happening around the globe no not always perhaps they want to start with a less important story that \nhasn't yet been reported then they must select whether to do a live interview a short video or \na long video it shouldn't be an issue because there is so much news however everything must be timed to \nthe second the newscasters must practice pronouncing the names of overseas cities \nand leaders furthermore they cannot be a second too short or a second too \nlong how did you know all this I have a master's degree in \njournalism and have taken some broadcasting classes I also did a radio program or a \npublic service announcement you have a lot of talent no not at all \noh and did I mention that I also did Community news for a radio station dialogue \n3 which newspaper do you like to read the Star Tribune is my go-to source for \nbreaking news however for local events I like the post rview what about the \nCambridge oh their news is not about what I'm interested in I enjoy the \neditorials in the Star Tribune particularly those by the guest editor \nrealism I'm thinking of sending an editorial to them really what subject \nwill it be about my thoughts on zoning rules and \nrestrictions I believe the city is not doing enough to curb urban sprawl I concur that's a terrific idea \nfor a topic on that point I believe everyone would agree with \nyou have you forgotten about the developers of Real Estate if I fired some bullets at them they'd \nbe as enraged as Hornets however it is ultimately up to \nthe city council to enact zoning rules and boundaries all right I'll do it \nthen everyday English conversations practice easy how are you \ndoing good morning Lucy good morning Jessica how are you doing I'm doing \ngreat thank you and you I'm good too thanks where are you going I'm just
