bunch of \nchopsticks start telling i'm very excited \nonce upon a time there was an old rich man who had two \nchildren the sons who were perpetually quarreling among themselves \nthe father must be very sad [Music] \nyeah so the dad wanted to teach his boys a lesson \na lesson right one day he gathered his children \nand told the servant to bring up a bunch of chopsticks the father told his children to break \nthe bunch of chopsticks at once \nso can they break it definitely no \nno matter how hard the younger son tried it did not work the older son was \nequally unable to break the sticks \nthen what then the father said try to break those chopsticks one by one \nimmediately his children were easily able to break that bunch of chopsticks \ntwo fathers want to teach their children about solidarity \nyes the father said if you work together as a team no one can defeat you and you \nshould be united in loving each other it's a valuable lesson [Music] \nPeople and Work \ntopic people and work [Music] \nthank you for spending your lunch break with me not at all what are you having problems \nwith well unfortunately i'm having a number of problems \noh what exactly is that i couldn't work on my computer all day \ndid your computer have a virus yes i opened a virus infected file \noh my goodness when opening files in your email you must exercise extreme caution \na virus might cause your entire computer to crash it was purely coincidental \ni had no idea the download included a virus i'll be more cautious next time \nwhat did you do after that i requested that a computer repairman \ncome to my office he spent the entire day repairing my laptop \n[Music] but the serious problem is that i'm afraid \nthe virus will lose the data on my computer don't be concerned \nyou know documents as well as important projects are saved on this computer \ni can assist you in reclaiming it but next time make sure you have backup files just in case it happens again \nthank you so much \nMy Future Job \ntopic my future job \nmia what do you want to be in the future i've always wanted to become a teacher \ni believe i would want to work with children to help them learn \nteachers as you know must work extremely hard for little pay \ni'm not concerned with money you know being a teacher has been a dream for me since childhood \nwhat subject would you like to teach like miss kim i want to teach english \nshe makes learning enjoyable i had no idea how much i would enjoy \nenglish until i enrolled in her class english i'm the worst at that subject \nme too but after taking miss kim's class i gradually fell in love with it \nenglish is my favorite subject if you want to teach english you must \nwork hard and learn it well i know what i need to do \nlast week i received an a on the english test and i'm trying to improve myself \nevery day learning is simple when you have excellent teachers like miss kim \nyeah right i want to be a teacher too but i want to

monet was a fantastic painter he was one of the first impressionists \noh i've heard that name before can you explain to me what impressionism is \nthe thing is impressionist artists were not trying to paint a reflection of real \nlife but an impression of the person light atmosphere object or landscape \nwho were the impressionists some of the main impressionist artists are claude monet \nberta morsat camille pisarro [Applause] [Music] \nhow did they paint before impressionism landscape and art were often imaginary \nperfect landscapes painted in the studio the impressionists changed all that \nthey painted outdoors [Music] \nwas this painting done outdoors by monet as well that's great \nyeah monet spent a lot of time painting outside he wanted to demonstrate how objects \nseemed in the light does he draw a lot of pictures related to the garden \nright garden scenes appear in several of his works he enjoyed painting flowers and trees \nhe enjoyed painting in his own yard does his garden still exist \nyes this garden now attracts a large number of tourists each year majority of them are art enthusiasts or \nartists [Music] \nNature and Environment \ntopic nature and the

on the grass here [Music] \noh my goodness someone forgot to dispose of these empty paper bags \nthere's rubbish all over the place \nwhy don't people throw garbage in the right place i don't know \nthese people have very poor consciousness it greatly affects the environment and \nsurrounding landscape there are also several empty cans and glass bottles under the tree \npeople should pick up after themselves and not leave rubbish behind that's correct \nso after our lunch let's clean up as much garbage as we can and get it out of here \nokay next week we can go with some people we'll clean up the trash in this park \nexcellent thought [Music] \nLets Recycle \ntopic let's recycle \nhello jane have you heard about the new legislation aimed at encouraging people to recycle \nthey were mentioning it in the news yesterday night i'm not sure i like them \ninstead of tossing away paper metal and glass the government aims to keep the \nenvironment clean by recycling them but who wants to spend an extra 50 cents \nfor a cup of coffee 50 cents a paper cup only costs 5 cents more \na rather expensive price but you can also receive your money back \nif you return the cup \ni think this policy has been approved by the government come to think of it \nthis is very good for the environment yeah from now on i'll return all of the \npaper coffee cups i use good we must all recycle \nit has to keep the environment clean \n[Applause] growing roses \nGrowing Roses \n[Music] \nplease excuse me ma'am my rose shrub is giving me trouble \nwhat is the problem it used to yield an abundance of pink \nroses \ni don't quite understand what you mean please tell me the details \nyeah now it is no longer producing any blooms \ni get what you mean that appears to be an issue do the plants leaves appear to be in \ngood condition no not at all the leaves were formerly extremely green \nthe majority of them have now gone brown \nso i believe your rose bush needs fertilizer okay \nwhat type of fertilizer do you recommend i use this liquid fertilizer is excellent \nit will aid in the re-greening of your rose leaves and will it flower again \nyes the plant should then begin to produce roses very shortly \nhow much the fertilizer is around ten dollars \nhow long will my rose bush need to recover i believe it'll take about two weeks \ngreat thank you very much [Music] \nBird Watching \ntopic bird watching [Music] \ntomorrow i want to go bird watching do you know of a nice bird watching location \nthere's a beautiful park nearby there are usually a lot of lovely birds there \nwill i be able to view a variety of birds in that park yes i believe so \neven if the birds are far away you may see them using binoculars \ngreat i have a book with pictures of all the different kinds of birds it appears that you enjoy bird watching \nsure do you want to accompany me tomorrow thank you but no i find bird watching to \nbe tedious that is not correct birds are fascinating creatures \nsome birds have brightly colored feathers some birds build unique nests in which to lay their eggs \nyou're very knowledgeable about birds right i love studying birds \nokay maybe i'll go with you [Music] \nTrees in the Forest \ntopic trees in the forest [Music] \nwhere did you go yesterday i looked for you i went to the tree fair to buy some \nsaplings who's organized this tree fare \nthe department of agriculture and forestry organizes this tree fair on the occasion of tree plantation week \nwhy do they organize this tree fare it appears strange to me that you're not \nyet fully aware of the importance of tree plantation \nright you are please tell me about the importance of tree plantation i want to know about it \nin detail trees are best friends they're great source of our food \nvitamins and furniture what will happen if trees continue to be cut at the present rate \nthe lives of all living beings will be in danger i see \nforests are the source of life they give man oxygen rain wood fruit \nbut do you notice that many unscrupulous people are cutting down trees at random \nwhat might be its consequence if they cut down trees indiscriminately \nthe country will one day turn into a desert the temperature will rise and it will \ncause the greenhouse effect now i understand why tree plantation is \nso important [Music] \nSuggestions \nwhy don't we go to the cinema there are many suggestions where people \nneed to suggest something so how many ways for suggestions are there \nwatch the video and learn from them what's for dinner \n[Music] \nwhat do you think about this homestay anna not bad \nbut i think it's a little expensive for a group of four \ni don't think so it's acceptable with this amazing view \nright this wonderful view makes me comfortable \nbut there is one thing what's the problem \ni guess it's quite far from here to the center of the town \nso we can't go to the restaurant for our dinner oh dear \nwe forgot that what should we do don't worry \nwhy don't we order online and they will ship meals for us \nthat's easy cool but i'm starving right now \nwe could order something now couldn't we sure \ni'm hungry too but the important thing now is what kind \nof food we will have for dinner we should decide what we eat \nfirst um why don't we eat fried chicken or pizza \ngood idea when we travel we only need to eat fast food \noh no but i and alex eat chicken yesterday \nwe don't really want to eat it um really \nso i suggest something hot [Music] \ngreat jack the first thing that comes to my mind is hot pot \nyes there is a famous hot pot restaurant near here \ni've read the review they're good \nis this a chinese restaurant that's right \na chinese hot pot seems to be a good suggestion

a similar problem when i buy trousers and find a pair the \ncorrect length the waist size is too big you are very tall \nhave you tried some of the other stores on the high street yes but the quality is not as good as \nhere i recently bought a cardigan and the sleeves ended just below the elbow \nthe salesperson said it was the fashion to have sleeves that length \nwell i suppose i could buy a blue shirt and tell everyone it is the latest \nfashion and have the shorter sleeves \nyes and it will allow your bracelet to be seen and not hidden by a long sleeve \nthanks i'll buy the blue t-shirt

i add just a little cheese \nbut i know anyone may like it cheesy and greasy i will get some more for you \nnormally we substitute an italian cheese for the swiss \nsince my father does not like the swiss [Music] \nwow vegetable is fresh i ordered from the home farm store \nit's better than the supermarket pass me the pepper please \ndo you like spicier yes \nand the salt as well i'm a salty eater it will be more delicious if it's \nseasoned in two hours before cooking however adding it now is fine \ni wish we had some wine come on joe \nwe need to drive home next time i will take the whiskey from \nour company for you and we will drink overnight \ndeal what is this cocktail linda i don't know the exact name i learned \nthe recipe on the internet it's made from pear and ginger \nat this season pears are so sweet [Music] i think it will be tastier if you add \nrosemaries no we have them with a steak already \nthe drink is suitable for red meat to be honest it is the first time i made \nthat drink luckily everyone liked its mild sour and sweet flavor \nafter dinner we gather in the living room to watch our favorite netflix series \n[Music] do you want to have some fruit or yogurt i made yogurt by myself \nlinda do you want to taste it i'm out honey i'm full \nwhat about the two of you linda and joe yes please \ni will test your cooking skill here you are \nlet's see hmm

the homework mr watson \ngave us it's due tomorrow so i haven't done anything \noh really what a relief but i'm afraid i got bad news \nchris is sick so he won't come to class today \nhe is sick with what exactly nobody told us \ni hope he is still doing fine well i only knew about this minutes ago \ni heard his mother talking with our teacher in the hall she mentioned him \ncatching a cold last night or something is he okay \nhis mother sounds not so worried about his condition so i assume he is fine \nif it's really just a common cold he will be fine in a few days \nshould we call him to check up on him i guess he could use some encouragement \nbut it's only seven in the morning \ni think he is still asleep let him have his rest \nsick people desperately need sleep to recover we can text him though \nhe can read it whenever he wakes up good idea \nwhat should we tell him just simply explain how we know he is ill and ask him for his condition first \nthen tell him we got him covered on schoolwork and other news \nalso tell him to take his medication seriously there was one time that he was sick but \ndelayed taking medication so it continued for like two weeks \nhe got ill more severe than a common cold i can't remember its name though \ni recalled anything else should we visit him after school \nokay but let's buy him some fruits along the way an apple a day keeps the doctor away \nand some oranges would help out a lot i agree then \ni'll tell him in advance what else can we do to help him \nmr watson homework knowing his nature i doubt he has given it a single thought \nwell then to help him is to help ourselves too \n[Music] hey guys chris is replying to me what did he say \nhe thanked us for caring and he got the best person around to look after him \ndoes he mean his mom yeah i also assume he was talking about \nhis mom too anyway chris told me that he is going well \nand he had enough fruits to last a week he would appreciate a visit from us \nthough then we will go straight to his house after school \ni guess so tell him that and also mention that tomorrow is the due date for mr watson's \nhomework and i'll tell him that we will come over to finish that thing too \nit's for the best okay i'll tell him exactly that \nwell then we will talk later okay [Music] \nthanks for watching don't forget to like share comment on my video
