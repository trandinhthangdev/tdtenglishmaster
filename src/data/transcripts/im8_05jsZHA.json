when sharon since when have you started lying to me \nlike this i am not lying to you peter i never have \nyou dare blame me when you are part of the reason as well oh \nso now you are blaming me is

to make everyone laugh \nwe miss everybody even peter in his practicing voice \nbut it was so terrible that our eardrums almost exploded i know but i'm used to living like that \nby the way how are things between you and peter we had a long conversation \nhe said it wasn't entirely my fault he realized he was too focused on work \nand ignored sharon's feelings and needs meanwhile i was always

right now he has you wrapped around his little \nfinger doesn't he and don't you dare deny it you never asked me about tom or \nmartin all right maybe a little bit i just feel really \nhappy whenever he is around so regardless of my opinion what do you \nthink about him alice and him as well what does he think about you \ni am not really sure yet right now we are still friends \ni think he is a bit too focused on work though he does not pay much attention to anything else \nhmm i'm not sure if i should say this but i don't have a good feeling about \nhim do you think he would have enough time to care for you being a director and all \ni don't know but we can always try look at your dad alice \nyou two don't seem to get along well since he is always going away for work right \nno edward is different i can feel it even if he is busy i can totally \nunderstand and get used to it yeah it's just my personal opinion if \nyour relationship is strong enough nothing can come in between [Music] \nokay so i need to put this in this bowl and alice in an egg \nalice alice you hear me yes sorry i'm really focused right now \nare you okay what are you doing i'm just preparing a small french style \nlunch for edward why so is he not canadian \nyes but his mom is french so i thought he would appreciate some familiar dishes \nhe must feel so homesick being here i can't believe

good lunch edward you might want to prepare yourself for a \nbig surprise oh these dishes look good and smell good \ntoo i must say you are not a terrible cook oh it is not what you're thinking i did

bye \nwhat was that anyway i am starving let me try some of this food \noh this is quite good it kind of tastes like my mom's cooking not bad at all \nto the guy who makes my heart melt what \nwho wrote this is this a prank focus edward \nthink okay so anne set up this table \nshe must be the one who wrote this then i'm so confused \nso i am filming myself because i am going through a weird situation right now \nand my housemate just left me this message it might not be her but she set this \ntable up so who else can it be right i am unsure because she is normally \nreally shy she got really annoyed the last time i filmed her without her permission \nanyway i find this so cute of her very interesting indeed \nbut i also am confused about what to do because this has never happened to me before \nhelp give me some suggestions should i ask her out on a date or something \ncan you turn the camera off i'm not comfortable being filmed edward \nedward excuse me why are you looking at me like that no nothing sorry \ni am just a bit tired whatever see you later remember wait for alice \noh i will see you later anne okay \nso that was her did you guys hear that she acted as nothing happened \nmy little shy girl anne how interesting i'm pretty sure she has feelings for me \nby now she definitely does or else she would not act like that \nwhat should i do now should i ask her about it no \ni should wait and see what she is going to do next right i need some time to think right now \ni will keep you guys updated please like this video and subscribe to \nmy channel so you do

[Music] \njack wait up can i ask you for some advice sure what do you need advice on \nthere is this girl who secretly confessed her feelings to me through a piece of paper \ni don't really know what to do right now talking about girls aren't we \nwell i am happy to inform you that you have asked the right person i'm an expert in love-related matters \nsure man anyway she even acted as nothing happened afterward \ni didn't expect it at all but i realized that i am also quite \ninterested in her the moment i saw her confession what should i do \nfirst of all she wrote her confession down on a piece of paper yes yes that's right with a delicious \nhomemade lunch as well it was so cute hmm so she must like that kind of thing \nyou know being secretive and all why don't you do the same to her \ni don't understand how do i do that exactly you are really clueless aren't you let's \nsee you must act mysterious for example you can send her a \nhandwritten message yourself surprise her invite her out for dinner or ask her to go see a movie with you \nsing her a song oh by her roses girls are definitely into that \nthat makes sense but do you think that might be too cheesy \ncheesy that is exactly what is going to win her over man you just gotta do it \ni am not quite sure if that is the case with this one but thank you for the advice i really \nappreciate it no problem let me know if you need anything else remember i am an expert in \nthis yes i will remember that thank you \n[Music] \nflowers check i should put it here on this table \nthe camera is set up the card next to the flowers awesome all good \ni wonder if ann would like this ah let's just give it a go dear anne \nroses are red violets are blue sugar is sweet and so are you \nmy lovely anne would you be willing to join me tomorrow night to hang out \ni will be waiting for you in the living room when everyone is asleep there will only be the two of us \nfrom your secret admirer okay this should do it \njack is at the gym and won't be home for another two hours alice is out somewhere \nand is going to be home the earliest so she should be the one getting this message perfect \nhello is there anybody home oh i need to go \nanyway what was i talking about yes sure see you then \nwhy suddenly someone in this house likes flowers what is this a card \noh wow this is for me dear anne roses are red violets are blue \nsugar is sweet and so are you my lovely anne would you be willing to \njoin me tomorrow night to hang out i will be waiting for you in the living room when everyone is asleep \nthere will only be the two of us from your secret admirer \ntomorrow night huh ah this is so sweet the poem is really cute \ntoo but who wrote this \ncan it be jack no way probably not but who else can it be then a stranger \nit must be jack then oh my god i can't believe this he finally changed \nhis mind i'm so happy \nhello anne hello my lovely little sister \nwhat made you so happy anne you seem really excited today oh yes i'm very happy indeed i got a \nsurprise it was so romantic you won't believe it if i told you \nthen tell me no i want to keep it a secret for now \nyou're so lame i just wanted to be sure first okay \nalice but i promise i will tell you soon whatever \nlove you by the way how are things going between you and edward any update \nand i regret giving him that card so much what happened \nnothing that is the problem he's acting like nothing ever happened like he did not read it \nwhat if he didn't no i'm sure he did i looked for the note afterward but i couldn't find it \nanywhere well did you ask him about it yes i asked him about lunch \nhe only said he was really happy with it and nothing else can you believe it \nmaybe he needs to focus on something else right now either that or he really doesn't like me \ni guess i just need to accept it don't be so discouraged i think you should tell him directly \nit is better that way you can convey your emotions to him and show him that you are really sincere \nmaybe that is better than a card you know what if he likes you but does not like \nthe way you confess your feelings no way in hell that is so stupid and \nembarrassing i will never do that up to you [Music] \nis someone here why is it so dark and my girl \ni'm so glad that you came can you follow my voice hmm \nwhy do you sound strange today you
