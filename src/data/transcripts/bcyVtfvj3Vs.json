\ncool [Music] \ndo you play basketball \nDo you play basketball? \n[Music] hi joey why do you look so sad \nhi mike i just received a bad mark in maths so i \nam very disappointed in myself i studied very hard last week for this \ntest but the result was so bad [Music] \ni'm sorry to hear that but you still have other exams ahead \ntry your best and show that you have in these next tests \ni always believe in you joey thank you mike you are my best friend \nyou are welcome by the way are you free this afternoon \ni want to help you reduce your sadness by doing something yes mike i will be free after this \nmorning what are you going to do with me hmm \nlet me see ah do you want to play basketball \ni will play it with some friends at 4pm would you like to join \nsorry joey i'd love to

i can show you some basic basketball skills \ni think you will get used to playing basketball soon because you're a smart boy \nbasketball is a good sport for students like us it helps you to grow your height and \nyour health as well furthermore i believe that you will reduce your \nstress by practicing basketball that sounds great mike \ni have always wanted to try playing basketball to gain an ideal height like \nyou but i don't have any time to play sports \nmy parents always ask me to go to extra classes after school \ni don't even have time to relax oh no joey \nit is so bad for you i think you should have a conversation with your parents \nyou can tell them about your needs and your love for the sport as well \nyour parents will realize their mistake and they will let you have more time to do some other activities \nplaying sports is really beneficial for students like us \nokay mike i will do as you said forget it so \nhow long does it cost me to play basketball fluently it will be quick \nabout a month if you play it regularly i will help you don't worry \nokay my friend 2 pm at the schoolyard right \nyes joey please arrive on time so we will have more time to get to
