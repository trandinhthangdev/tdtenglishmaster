    "transcript": "Intro \n[Music] \nbuying \ngifts three classmates \nbibi james and melanie all have family \nmembers with special \noccasions coming up watch the video \nto see them deciding on what to buy for \ntheir loved ones \nShopping \nso what's so important that we have to \ngo to the mall right after school \nmy mom's birthday is this friday \nand i need someone to help me choose a \ngift for her \nwow and you choose me \nyes i decided that i'll get her an item \nof clothing \na dress or a top and i know you're good \nat fashion so that's why \nall right that's understandable so do \nyou have any particular shop in mind \nthere are like over 10 stores in this \nmall that sell clothes for middle-aged \nwomen \nand we don't have time to visit all of \nthem \nactually i don't but we won't go \ninto all the stores \nwe can just look from the outside and \nsee if that shop has something suitable \nfor my mom \ni guess that's fine too \nhey there's a shop over there that seems \nvery nice \nlet's take a look are you sure \nthe clothes there look very luxurious \ni don't think my budget is enough for \nthat place \nreally then we will find another store \ni don't have very little money but i \ndon't have a lot \nthat i can spend without thinking so we \nhave to be very selective and careful \nokay i get it i'm a little bit \nworried and this small seems like a \ncostly one \ndon't worry we will find something \neventually \nif the clothes are too expensive you can \nget your mom some kind of \naccessories instead accessories \nthat's a great idea i haven't considered \nthat \ndo you want to change your decision \nbecause i think that getting someone \nclothes \nis quite difficult if they're not here \nand if you're not a professional \nwell you might be right \nyes there can be tons of problems like \nhow it fits \nwill the color suit the person's skin \ntone etc \nall right then i'll switch to buying \naccessories \ni recommend a small shoulder bag or a \nwallet \noh that won't be necessary my mom just \ngot a new one last week \nhow about sunglasses it's nearly summer \na nice pair to use in your family's \nsummer trip might be ideal \nthat sounds great let's go \n[Music] \nSunglasses \nhere this door is good it's a bit \noverpriced \nfor sunglasses but it's definitely \ncheaper than clothes \nlet's choose a pair with some extra \ndecorations \nmy mom always goes for those sunglasses \nthat seem extremely expensive \nhey how about this \nit's a bit too simple for me \nbesides the bright color will darken \nyour mom's skin for sure \nwhat a shame i really like these little \ngold flowers \ni think your mom might like this pair \nnice but how much is it \noh no i need five more dollars to \npurchase this \nthen take this one it's not as sparkly \nbut \nit's more detailed and it's ten dollars \ncheaper than the previous pair \nlet me look at it for a little bit \nlonger \nokay i think we just found the perfect \ngift for my mom \namazing trust me she will love this \npresent \na lot i certainly hope so \nGifts \n[Music] \ngood morning chris oh \njames hi hey \ni have a piece of interesting news \nmy little brother brian just won first \nprize in a debate competition \nand to think he's only 13 years old \nno way that's amazing he's really a \ngenius \nindeed i'm so proud of him \nmy family is having a small dinner party \ntomorrow to congratulate him properly \nand i really want to get some gifts for \nhim you know \nas a means of encouragement \nthat's very thoughtful of you \nthanks but i still don't have anything \nin mind right now \ndoes your brother like reading \nactually he only reads comics \nbut my parents don't like that and he \nalready has a huge \nshelf of comics so if i buy more they \nmight be mad at me \n[Music] \nthen you might get him a unique rubik's \ncube perhaps \nthe type that has 12 sides \nthe last time i went to your house i \nnoticed that he was so engaged in \nplaying with his rubik's cube \nthat he didn't even know i was there \nit was over a month ago at first i also \nthought of that \nbut i think he's grown out of it \noh then that's difficult \nyeah at first i thought choosing a gift \nfor a little boy is easy \nbut then i struggled for an entire day \nwithout any idea what to get him \ni just want to make sure that he will \nlike it \ni'm thinking that you should buy him an \nencyclopedia \nbut the actual informative one for \nadults is too expensive \nbesides i don't think your brother will \nbe able to understand everything in it \nmy grandpa actually does have one \nmy brother was really interested in it \nbut it's true that he couldn't \nunderstand everything \nthere was too much information about too \nmany fields \nor you can get him scrabble perhaps \nthat's actually quite a nice idea \ni think this gift is suitable \nit's good for your brain it expands your \nvocabulary \nand your entire family can play together \nit's really fun i think you're right \ni'll consider it \nthanks for your suggestion chris you're \nthe best \nyou're welcome \nStory Time \n[Music] \nharry are you free right now \nyes what's the matter \nyou know mom and dad are celebrating \ntheir 20th year of marriage \nsoon we have to think about a present \noh right i was too busy that i almost \nforgot \nit's fine it's still over a week left \ni decided that i'll draw something but \nwe need more \ni agree wait \nbut should we buy each of them different \npresents or \njust one present for both \nif we get individual gifts it will be \neasier \nbut this is a celebration of them being \ntogether \nso i think one present for both will be \nmore meaningful \nall right let me search for something \ndo you think we have enough time and \nbudget to throw a surprise dinner party \nmoney isn't a problem and both of us can \ncook well \nbut our parents always go to the \nrestaurants where they had their first \ndate to celebrate \nit has become a tradition now and i kind \nof don't want to break it \nit's romantic you know \noh there's this really cute engraved \nwood block \nthey will carve the couple's names the \nnumber of years they've been together \nand so many meaningful things \nshall we consider it i like it but i'm \nafraid it's going to take a while to \nmake \nall right one block of wood will be \nfinished in at least \n10 days that's too long \nit won't arrive on time for the \nanniversary \nwhat a pity well \ni see this nice pair of mugs that take \nless time to customize \nwe only have to wait three days \nand you know mom and dad always drink \ncoffee or tea together \nevery morning before going to work \nperfect we should get it in all white or \none green mug in one yellow mug like mom \nand dad's favorite color \ni think white will be better it looks \nmore \nluxurious and also this \nshop only customs white mugs \nokay i'll come up with a design later \nand show you \nwe can continue discussing then agree \nagree \n[Music] \nthanks for watching don't forget to like \nshare comment on my video please \nsubscribe to learn english with jessica \nchannel \nto watch more helpful videos goodbye \nyou \n"
