    "transcript": "[Music] \nin the makeup store \nevery girl loves makeup tina also \nshe went to a beauty store to buy her \nfirst makeup kit \nwatch the video to learn vocabularies \nabout beauty and cosmetics topic \n[Music] \nhello may i help you are you looking for \nsomething \nhi i'm looking for a full basic makeup \nset \nthis is my first time buying those \nthings \nso i don't know what exactly i need \napart from lipsticks and powder \nno worries let me help you \nwe can find a lipstick for you first \nthen maybe i will tell you a bit about \nthe steps to apply makeup \nthen we can choose the products \naccording to those steps for you \nokay thanks a lot i'm still not too sure \nabout all these i'm glad you help \nmy pleasure \nlet me see you seem to have a light skin \ntone \nso those lipsticks with bright and deep \ncolors will fit you perfectly \nnormally i use pink lipsticks so i want \nto try some new colors \nlet's try this one then \nmaybelline lipstick shade 382 red for me \nit has a moderately cool toned medium \ndark red with a matte finish \nthis one looks gorgeous \ni like it \nthis kind of matte lipstick will stay \nlonger however your lips will feel a bit \ndry \nso don't forget to soften your lips with \nlip balm like 10 minutes before applying \nthe lipstick \nokay \ni will get this one any other \nrecommendations \nlet me put it in this basket for you \nhow about orange l'oreal brand shade \norange avenue 146 satin finish \nit looks somehow wetter and softer but \ncannot stay as long as a matte finish \nwow i love it \nvery comfortable and smooth \noh by the way i also need a lip balm can \nyou recommend one \nour customers really love this burt's \nbees lip balm pomegranate flavor \nsmells good i'll take these two also \ni think that's enough for lips \nokay so let's get over to the face part \nis that okay \nsure this is the part i have no idea \nabout \n[Music] \nafter using moisturizer and sunscreen to \nprotect your skin \nthe first step is preparing your face \nwith primer \nusing primer under your makeup makes \nyour look last longer \ndo you know your skin type \ni'm not sure but i usually have a bit of \noil around my nose and forehead but \nother parts are normal \ni think you have a combination skin type \nfor this type of skin i recommend nyx \nmarshmallow primer our best seller the \nlast month \nhow to apply primer \ncan i use my fingers \nyes you pump out a bit of primer on the \nback of your hand mix it with your \nfinger and dab it all over your face \nthen gently rub it in okay i got it \n[Music] \ni think your face doesn't have many \nflaws you don't need concealer so let's \nmove to the foundation \nokay if you say so \nthis is a very important step to have a \nperfect skin look i suggest these two \nproducts \nmaybelline fit me or l'oreal true match \nfoundation \nthese light shades will suit your skin \ntone you can try and tell me which one \nyou prefer \n[Music] \num \nlet me see \ni will take this maybelline one i prefer \nthe matte finish it seems to have a \nbetter coverage also \nright \nafter foundation you should apply \nsetting powder this step is optional but \nif you're looking for long lasting \ncrease free makeup you should use it \nsure i want one anyway \nwhenever i need a quick makeup look \nwithout foundation or reapplying during \nthe day i can use it \nso why not use maybelline fit me powder \nalso great combo for your skin let's \ntake this shade \n115 ivory \nokay \ndo you need contour and a highlighter to \nmake your face slimmer \nno i think that's too much for me i just \nneed basic kinds of stuff \nokay so skip those things \nyou will surely need to blush i \nrecommend this l'oreal peach blush \npowder \nit has a refreshing peachy color and can \nbe easily matched with many makeup tones \nthis one is our signature blush recently \nvery lovely i will take it \ni guess those are enough for your facial \nmakeup now let's move to the eye part \n[Music] \nwow it seems a lot to me already \ni know i know i had the same feeling \nwhen i bought my first makeup kit so you \nwill need eyebrows eyeshadow eyeliner \nand mascara \nokay \nplease help me choose something easy to \nuse i'm really not good at this \nsure then use pencil type for eyebrows \nand eyeliner \nyour hair is light brown so let's take \nthese chocolate eyebrows and eyeliner \npencils from nyx \ntry this on your hand to see \nthat's great really fits my hair color \ngive me these two \nokay for mascara \ntrust me you will love this maybelline \none we have received really good reviews \nfrom customers for it \nsure then take this one \nokay finally you need eye shadow do you \nlike any of these \nthis palette looks so gorgeous \nright but that palette has kind of two \nbright colors for you in my opinion \nit will be difficult for you to mix with \ndaily makeup tones \nbecause this is your first one i suggest \nyou should try a neutral tone \nhow about this one \nsame brand and product line from \nrevolution \nlet me see \nit has 24 shades that give you \neverything you need for your look \nfrom light shimmers warm browns rich \ngolds rusty oranges and dark smoky \nshades \nthis one looks great as well let me take \nthis then \nokay \ni think that's all you need \noh have you had makeup brushes yet \nno thanks for reminding me i need those \ntwo \nthere are so many types of brushes what \ntype do i need \nreal techniques everyday essentials set \nis all you need this one has four \nbrushes with a sponge \nyou can find the instructions to use \nthose brushes on the back of the \npackaging but basically it is enough for \nyou to apply foundation to eyeshadow \nthanks a lot for your help i can't \nimagine how long i will spend here \nwithout your help there are too many \nproducts to choose from \nyou're welcome it's my pleasure to help \nyou \nhere is your basket with all those \nproducts \nthank you \ni will go to the checkout counter now \nhave a nice \nday thanks you have a nice one too \n[Music] \nthanks for watching don't forget to like \nshare \ncomment on my video \nplease subscribe to learn english with
