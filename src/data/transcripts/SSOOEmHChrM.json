for all there is no such thing as private property \nis everyone work yes for the benefit of everybody not \njust individuals what if some individuals work harder and more efficient than others \nthey will not be permitted to exert influence over others do you mean it's just as nice to be lazy \nas it is to be hard-working workers and peasants will rule society \nthey are not as lazy as industrial

talent you are a real painter \ni can tell you're pulling my leg now pulling your leg what does this imply \nit means you're joking no i'm not kidding your painting is \nundeniably beautiful dialogue three \nhave you any special abilities i wouldn't say i have any special \ncapabilities but when i was younger i used to write a lot and people were always surprised by \nmy poems why don't you do it anymore it was an obsession in the past for me \ni'd rather live a regular life now sorry to hear that but do you think you \ncould have achieved fame if you had persisted i think possibly \nmy friend barry is an example he and i used to fantasize about taking \nover the literary world he persisted and ultimately he was \nsuccessful very famous in the literary world i don't believe he was any more gifted \nthan i was why did you quit up when he was successful \ni prefer to eat than write making appointments \nMaking appointments \ndialogue one can we change the time from today to tomorrow at 10

venture project is that mr david harris or mr robert \nterrace i'm not certain he just addressed himself as mr harris \nwell it's most likely david i'll inquire no it isn't him so it's got to be robert \nhe is in room 306 on the third level you may now get up there \nthank you very much [Music] \nfeelings and emotions dialogue one \nDialogue 1 \nwhat's the problem what i never said anything

it \nwell i'm a little worried about work because i recently applied for a transfer to another office \nthat is enough to make anyone scared when will you learn the outcome about three or four days \num relax you seem exhausted that's because the job is really hard \nand i also have to study for a class at night wow you're undoubtedly feeling a lot of \npressure yes i think so i'm going to take

knows that you are unable to return from china \nat that time um about wade's wife i don't like her very much \ni understand that it may take time for you to get along with kate your new sister-in-law \ni'm not going to speak with her she's arrogant and rude anyway she's your sister-in-law \nif you do like that you'll make wade awkward i know when are you going to be able to return \nhome on or

wonderful day \nyou as well goodbye dialogue too \ni want to have a traditional chinese dress like this design can you do it \ndo you mean a keeper right i want it to look like this design \ni like a black background with red dragons looks good this is a very traditional \ndesign what is its price depending on the fabric you choose \nsilk is more expensive but it has more appealing appearance of course polyester is less expensive \nhow many meters of fabric do i need for this dress this also depends on your height the \nlength of the sleeves and the neckline i want the sleeve length to be 3 4 with \nslits along the sides i got it it will probably take about 2 \nmeters and you also need to buy a lining for it what about those beautiful tiny \nfasteners on the dress oh in china those are referred to as buttons \nthey are known as frogs in the united states dialog three \ni really want to buy you the plaid skirt no this design will make me appear \noverly chubby no way why you think that you're thin as a rail \nyou'd blow away in the breeze if you were thinner in fact i believe a dark hue would be \npreferable it is the basic color and also easy to coordinate with other colors \nthe whole wardrobe is dark it looks boring i think you should lighten up \nokay perhaps you're correct i could wear a lighter hue but not that plaid \nit appears to be overly childish it's the new trend in autumn do you not \nread any fashion magazines oh so do you often read fashion \nmagazines yeah i'm interested in seeing how they match the new season's colors and keep \nup to date with new trends are you certain that is all you do \nmaybe you enjoy looking at fashion models \nhousehold objects and tools dialog one \nHousehold objects and tools \nhey chris what exactly are you looking for i'm looking for remote control i don't \nsee it anywhere tv remote no i'm referring to the dvd player \nis it absolutely necessary yeah if i need to pause the movie or \nchange to a different scene have you looked for it everywhere \nis it trapped in the couch i looked for it there how long has it been since you last saw \nit i was watching the news this morning i was using it to switch channels \nhmm so where could it be i also wonder where it is \noh here in the midst of a heap of newspapers oh well i'm curious how it got there \ni don't know anyway thanks for finding it what would you do if you didn't have me \ndialogue too fortunately my roommate moved to another apartment \nwhy did you say that she was always utilizing my items without my permission \nshe arbitrarily used my ruler paper stapler tape and other supplies \ndid you remind her no i have not you know it might be tough \nto mention these topics with friends or roommates at times you should have probably stated the \nground rules first you wouldn't have been so irritated if she hadn't utilized your belongings \nyes i will notify my roommate not to use my belongings without my consent the next time \nor even better i won't have a roommate that would save a lot of time and effort \nlive and learn as they say maybe you're right politics \ndialogue one who are you going to vote for that is a secret i don't think i need to \ntell you really but i can tell you i voted for hollins \nallen's why he's such an idiot oh \nso you must have voted for roberts sure i did he has very serious plans for \nactual transformation and how do you suppose he'll perform all that he's told \nthere's a budget surplus the government has extra money it's not enough for all his schemes he \nattends to boost taxes i'm willing to spend a bit more if it means a better quality of life for all \nof us pay more taxes i don't want to \nwhy although holland stated that he would not raise taxes this does not make him a good president \nas a result he is a low-cost president he'd let me spend my money as i wanted \ninstead of paying more taxes why don't you agree to pile more taxes \nobviously not they didn't earn it i did so i want to spend on what i want \nwhat about those less fortunate than us are you going to take care of them \ni suppose so if individuals like you aren't willing to do it \ndo you believe you have all the answers at the very least i'm considering the \nquestions dialogue 2 \nDialogue 2 \n[Music] i'm sure you're relieved your time on \nthe city council is done yeah it's really a lot of pressure and \nsometimes it was a headache why do you say that you can satisfy some of the people all \nthe time and all of the people some of the time abraham lincoln observed but he can't \nsatisfy all the people all the time that quote i believe is incorrect \ni believe it was fool the people rather than pleasing the people you know there was no way you could \nplease everyone all the time that's quite typical someone will always object to something no matter what you \nsay or do i'm not sure why people like politics so much it always makes them stressed \nit's worth getting into politics and i was just elected to the city council \nconsider working in state or federal government well i must say that i appreciate your \nbehavior if only more people were like you it would be worthwhile \nmedia dialogue one \n[Applause] what are you now reading \noh i see there's a topic in the paper i'm not sure whether i agree with the author \nwhat is the article about i believe his political viewpoints are skewed \neveryone has their own opinion i think the journalist should not put his personal opinion in the article \nexcept for an editorial story oh my each newspaper has its own style \nsome papers are liberal while others are conservative i know but this author appears to be \nprejudiced toward the president and you don't agree \nhonestly his point is very convincing simply consider what he says will you \nremember it i'm still trying to do that it is beneficial to read stuff with \nwhich you disagree it helps to keep your mind sharp yeah this newspaper makes me unable to \nrefute because my theoretical point is too sketchy see \nthat is true for everyone and it is wonderful to recognize that \njust wait till i read another tale in favor of the president dialogue two \n[Applause] i don't believe the station does a good \njob of covering the news i don't agree being a news director must be a demanding job \nso what is its difficulty they must pick which news is the most significant or what to start with this \nis what draws viewers in that shouldn't be that difficult it is just what is happening around the globe \nno not always perhaps they want to start with a less important story that hasn't yet been reported \nthen they must select whether to do a live interview a short video or a long video \nit shouldn't be an issue because there is so much news however everything must be timed to the \nsecond the newscasters must practice pronouncing the names of overseas cities \nand leaders furthermore they cannot be a second too short or a second too long \nhow did you know all this i have a master's degree in journalism and have taken some broadcasting classes \ni also did a radio program or a public service announcement you have a lot of talent \nno not at all oh and did i mention that i also did community news for a radio station \ndialogue 3 which newspaper do you like to read \nthe star tribune is my go-to source for breaking news however for local events i \nlike the post review what about the cambridge oh their news is not about what i'm \ninterested in i enjoy the editorials and the star tribune particularly those by the guest \neditor realism i'm thinking of sending an editorial to them \nreally what subject will it be about my thoughts on zoning rules and \nrestrictions i believe the city is not doing enough to curb urban sprawl \ni concur that's a terrific idea for a topic on that point i believe everyone would \nagree with you um have you forgotten about the developers of real estate \nif i fired some bullets at them they'd be as enraged as hornets \nhowever it is ultimately up to the city council to enact zoning rules and boundaries \nall right i'll do it then \nthanks for watching don't forget to like share comment on my video \nplease subscribe to learn english with jessica channel to watch more helpful \nvideos goodbye \n"
