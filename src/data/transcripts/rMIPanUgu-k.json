how Ace Luna and Luca celebrate \na surprise party for their friends Mia \n[Music] \nguys Mia said that she would go home \nlate tonight \nso we don't have to wait for her \npoor her she's been

also works on Saturday \nif so maybe we can celebrate a surprise \nbirthday \nhey I'll go with it \nyeah let's do it together \nwe need to make a detailed plan first \ndo you guys want to make or buy a cake \nI think making a cake will be more \nmeaningful \nI agree \nthen first we should go to the \nsupermarket to find the ingredients \nwait we don't have any tools to make a \ncake \nall right so how about this \nLuna and Luca you guys will buy \ningredients \nand I will go to the baking supplies \nsection \nwhat kinds of supplies do you think \nwe'll need \nnot sure \ndo you have any idea \nwe already have an oven and enough bowls \nso I think you will have to buy a cake \npan a whisk and a mixer \nokay I remember it \nwe should also search for a cake recipe \non the internet \nto make a list of ingredients as well \nsure thing \napart from a cake I think we should \ndecorate our house as well \nthen after buying the necessary things \nfor making a cake \nwe will go to the home decoration \nsection \nI think it will take about three hours \nto make a cake \nso how about I go home before you guys \nprepare the cake \nthat's a great idea \nso Luca and I will stay in the \nsupermarket to look for decoration stuff \nLuna will go home first with the \ningredients and tools to make the cake \nright \nthat's correct \nhey guys I want to buy flowers for Mia \nas well \nwill we have enough time to do so \nperhaps after leaving the supermarket \nace and I will go to the flower shop to \nschedule flower delivery \nwhat time does Mia often go home on \nSaturday \nshe often leaves at 8am and comes back \nat 5 pm \nso Luna will make the cake and Ace and I \nwill decorate our living room \nthen we will receive our bouquet at \naround 4 30 P.M \nand wait until Mia
