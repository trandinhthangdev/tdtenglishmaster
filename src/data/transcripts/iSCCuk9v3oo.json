    "transcript": "Intro \n[Music] \ndream house \nHi everybody \nmary is being interviewed by james \nabout their dream house \nmary i would like to interview you about \nyour dream house \nyou only need to describe what is in \nyour mind while talking about \nthis topic okay \nsounds good to me let's start with your \nhouse \nand the environments around it shall we \ni'm ready just ask away what is your \nfavorite kind of house \nit's a typical suburban house in america \nthose ones that have a large backyard \nand two driveways leading to the front \ndoor and the garage \nthose houses that are mass produced by \nbig construction companies that are \nsimilar to others nearby \ni'm imagining just that \nwhat is the main attractiveness of those \nhouses \na neighborhood with little differences \nbetween the houses yet having their own \npersonality \nin my mind that kind of neighborhood \nsparks peacefulness and freedom \nit gave me a sense of belonging in a way \nwonderful and you have a very specific \nmindset and idea about the area around \nyour home too \nso i'm curious what kind of neighbors \nwould you be comfortable living by \nWhat kind of neighbors \nneighbors let me think about that for a \nbit \nhaving a nice cat lady living nearby \nwould surely be a great experience \nyoung couples who have little kids would \nalso attract my attention \nIm an outgoing person \nand what are the main reasons \nbecause little kids who are curious and \nenergetic \nare very cute and quite joyful to play \nwith \ni'm an outgoing person so making new \nfriends is one of the most \nexciting things in my life \nand the reason why i like cat ladies is \nthat i also \nam a cat lover too but \ntoo busy to raise one myself \nbesides old people are experienced \nso asking them for life advice from time \nto time is beneficial \ninteresting please go on what about the \ncontrast \nwhat sort of person living in your \nneighborhood that \nyou would not get along with \ntop of my list being toxic middle-aged \nmen whose life goal \nis to bring suffering to others \nCan you be more specific \ncan you be more specific when i was only \na kid there was a man \nliving several houses away who was both \nmean \nand scary he was extremely hated \nby more than half of our neighborhood \nfor his deeds \ni don't really want to recall so can we \nmove on \nof course let's focus more on your house \nthen \nhow many rooms do you want it to have \nMinimum preferably \nminimum preferably well my ideal house \nshould have at least two bedrooms a \nkitchen a separate dining room \nand a living room i can use three or \nfour bedrooms because later in time \nit can be put into great use \nand three bathrooms around the house \njust to be sure \nis there any specific reason for this \nlineup to be ideal mary \nwell one of the bedrooms would be for me \nand my future husband \nand the other is for my kids \nthe dining room to me should be \nseparated from the living room \nsimply because one is for family \ngatherings \nand the other is for having guests and \nrecreation activities \nThree bathrooms \nwhat about having three bathrooms \nimagine one for each bedroom and the \nother is shared \nyes that is my original intention \nin my home the bathroom should be a \npersonalized space that is filled with \nequipment dedicated to relaxation and \nself-care \nyour mindset is fantastic by the way \ni rarely see anyone with such details \nthank you james i was raised in a \nwonderful family my parents allow me to \nhave my personal space and we cherish \nthe family time we have together \nmy open-mindedness is also a gift from \nmy mom \nOpenmindedness \nvery cool by the way what are the things \ninside your dream home that deprived you \nof your childhood home \nwell firstly the personal bathrooms and \nthe separation between the dining room \nand the living room \nsecondly is the type of house in \nneighborhood \ni lived in the suburban area in my \nyounger years for the familiarness \nto that area stuck with me so \nhow does your dream house differentiate \nitself from your childhood house \nthe paint is the first thing that comes \nto mind \ni want my dream house to be bright and \nkind of colorful sky blues \nand sea blues would definitely cover \nmost of my front \nalong with a white and light green \ndoorway \nthe garage might as well be a deep blue \nbut anyway that's my only current \nthought \nThe inside \nhow about the inside there are a lot of \nchoices \nso i can't decide yet \nthe range of choices is simply endless \nisn't it that's right \nso maybe later in time i will know more \nprecisely \nThe furniture \nokay that's okay so what about the \nfurniture \nwhere would you want me to start the \nliving room and dining room are some \ngood starters \ni'm particularly fond of long sofas \nand utilized couches \nthose couches can have multiple things \nyou see \na round central table with glass tops \nand drawers \nvery child friendly some cupboards and \ndrawers pressed against the walls \na tv attached to the wall at eye level \nand \nloudspeakers i would love to be able to \nhear the music that comes from those \nspeakers when i'm cooking in the kitchen \neverything else is optional such as \ndecorations and \nrecreational stuff how about the dining \nroom furniture \ntwo more cupboards to display and store \nkitchen and eating stuff such as plates \nand bowls \na small electrical furnace in case it \ngot chilly along with a collection of \nseen candles \nScene candles \nyou were also fond of scene candles \noh recently i was introduced to this \nwonderful stuff \nby one of my roommates electric \nscene makers are great but are nowhere \nnear as sensational \na great point there anything else \nChandelier \na chandelier maybe \ni found those crystally ones are \nfabulous but not very suitable for a low \nceiling house \nbut that will go into consideration \nlater \napart from that a robot vacuum cleaner \nand one of those \nalexas who will be a nice touch to the \nhouse \nModern \ngoing modern aren't you i want my dream \nto be house \nto be as modern as possible but i \nhaven't gotten enough knowledge about it \nbut in the future the list will \ndefinitely be longer \nBedroom \nhow about your bedroom i would rather \nnot \ntalk about it yet you see i will share \nmy bedroom with my future husband so \ni don't want to think about it yet \nthat will be a later discussion between \nme and him \nit's the same for the bathrooms i \nKitchen \nunderstand \nis there anything that makes your dream \nkitchen special to you \nif i have the financial capability \ni want my kitchen to be equipped with \nall the basic utilities \nalong with luxurious stuff \ni'm talking about masterchef level of \nfurniture \ni'm a self-taught cooker but it doesn't \nstop me from going pro \nOutro \nfascinating so \nthank you for allowing me to carry out \nthis interview with you \nit has been a great pleasure listening \nto you i've got so much meaningful \ninformation from you \nthank you james i hope to talk to you \nlater in the future \ngoodbye \n[Music] \nthanks for
