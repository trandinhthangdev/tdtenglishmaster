    "transcript": "Intro \n[Music] Cy all you \nCry all you want! \nwant have you ever felt like everything is just too overwhelming all the time especially \nwith all these college applications and exams it feels like the wave of the \nworld is on our shoulders I know what you mean sunight i' burst into tears just \nthinking about it really I mean I get stressed too but \ncrying yes Jake sometimes crying helps me release all that tension cry all you \nwant then you might feel better I never thought about it that way I always felt \nlike I needed to keep it all in that's what many of us think but it's okay to let your feelings \nout maybe you're right sometimes I feel like screaming or just getting away from \neverything and that's perfectly okay everyone has their own way of coping if \ncrying helps you then do it there's no shame it's \njust I've been taught that crying shows weakness especially for \nguys that's a stereotype Jake we're all humans with emotions guys cry girls cry \nit's natural thanks Amy I'll try to remember that next time I feel the pressure \nbuilding \nup Love is \nLove is blind \nBlind you look so thoughtful today what's on your mind just thinking about relationships \nyou know especially after watching the romantic movie that you suggested oh the one with the unlikely \ncouple yes that one it got me thinking why do people fall for someone so \ndifferent from them well they do say that Opposites Attract but sometimes it's more than \njust attraction it's like love is blind you know that's so true sometimes love \ndoesn't make sense on the surface but deep down it feels right and it's it's crazy how love can \nmake you overlook certain things even flaws absolutely I think when you truly \nlove someone you see past their imperfections it's the person inside that \nmatters do you believe in soulmates like two people destined to be \ntogether no matter what I'm not sure about Destiny but I believe in deep \nconnections some people just fit together maybe that's the magic of love \nit's mysterious and \nunpredictable never do that \nNever do that again! \n[Music] again hey have you seen my notebook I \nleft it on the table this morning oh the one with the blue \ncover I might have taken it to class by mistake I thought it was mine \nyou should have checked first I had some personal stuff written in there I'm really sorry Lisa I just grabbed it in a \nhurry without looking please never do that again it's important to respect others \nbelongings I understand I won't let it happen again please tell me you didn't read \nanything I promise I didn't when I realized it wasn't mine I immediately closed it thank you for being honest \njust just be more careful next time I definitely will be again I'm really \nsorry about that it's okay mistakes happen just make sure to return it I will right after \nclass thanks for \nunderstanding I brought home the \nI brought home the trophy \ntrophy hey how did the competition go today Alex it was fantastic guess \nwhat what did you win yes I brought home the \ntrophy that's amazing Mia congratulations your hard work is paid \noff thank you I still can't believe it the final round was so \nchallenging I knew You' do great you've been practicing for months it feels real everyone was so \ngood I honestly didn't expect to win well I always had faith in you can I \nsee the trophy sure here it is it's heavier than it \nlooks wow it's beautiful you should be really \nproud I am but I couldn't have done it without all the support from you and the \nothers that's what friends are for and you surely deserve it \nwe have body weight \nWe have bodyweight training \ntraining how have you been Sarah it's been a while Jake I've been good been \nreally busy with work and hitting the gym recently or \nreally I've been thinking about joining a gym I need to get in \nshape you definitely should my sister and I joined one a month ago and it's \nbeen great do you go regularly I always find it hard to motivate \nmyself oh I used to feel the same but guess what we have a personal trainer he \nkeeps us on track that's a good idea having someone to guide you can be \nhelpful absolutely it's a game changer he creates personalized workouts for us \nand even gives nutrition advice sounds like something I need how \ndo you find the experience it's challenging but also rewarding our trainer David pushes us \nbut ensures we don't overdo it that's great maybe I should think about getting \na personal trainer too I highly recommend \n[Music] it he tries more care y than you \nHe drives more carefully than you do \n[Music] do hey Emma how was your \nweekend hi Mark it was good I went out with Tom and we took a long drive to the \ncountryside that sounds nice who was driving Tom was you know he drives more \ncarefully than you do oh come on I'm not that bad I didn't mean it in a bad way it's \njust an obs a he's very cautious on the road I get it maybe I should take a few \ntips from him it might be a good idea safety first \nright true I've had a couple of close calls recently that's what worries me Mark \nit's better to be safe and slow than fast and risky you're right Emma I'll \ntry to be more careful from that one that's what I wanted to hear stay safe out there \nthanks Emma I appreciate your concern always Mark take \n[Music] care I wasn't sure if I liked him or \nI wasn't sure if I liked him or not \nnot hey Lisa how was the Meetup Group yesterday it was good Sarah I met a lot \nof new people and there was this one guy Tom he was quite \ninteresting oh tell me more about him well he's tall has dog hair and he's \nreally into hiking we talked a lot and really enjoyed ourselves that sounds \ngood but I wasn't sure if I liked him or not you've always liked adventurous \npeople why the uncertainty I don't know maybe because he talked a lot about \nhis ex it made me feel feel a bit uncomfortable ah I get it it can be a \nred flag for some but maybe he was just nervous and didn't know what to talk about maybe \nyou're right I'll see how it goes if I bump into him again thanks \nSarah he was a horrible [Music] \nHe was a horrible dancer \ndancer how was the party last night Jenna oh it was fun Mia there was so \nmuch dancing and music I love dancing did you \ndance yes a few times but there was this guy Mark he was a horrible \ndancer oh no did he step on your feet not only mine but almost every ones \nhe danced with it was funny and a bit awkward at the same time well at least \nhe he tried maybe he should take some dance lessons I think so but it added some \nhumor to the party for sure I enjoyed it regardless that's the spirit everyone \nhas their strengths and weaknesses absolutely and dancing is \ndefinitely not Mark's [Music] \nstrength hand me the \nHand me the hammer! \nhammer oh you finally decided to fix that old \nchair Alex yes I thought it would be a fun weekend \nproject that sounds interesting need any help sure could you hand me the hammer \nit's on that table here you go oh and I found some \nnails too perfect thanks for helping out no problem it's nice to see you \ndoing something something handson yeah I always find it relaxing plus it saves \nmoney true let me know if you need any more tools we'll do thanks \n[Music] honey don't be \nDon\u2019t be nervous! \n[Music] nervous Hey Jake how are you feeling \nabout your presentation today honestly Mia I'm I'm super \nnervous I've never spoken in front of such a big crowd before don't be nervous \nyou've practiced so much and you know your topic inside out thanks Mia it's just that public \nspeaking has always been a challenge for me everyone feels that way at first just \ntake deep breaths and imagine everyone in funny hats funny hats \nyes it's an old trick to help you relax trust me it helps I'll give it a shot thanks for the \nadvice Mia no worries Jake you've got \nthis I used to have a \nI used to have a goldfish \ngoldfish have you ever had a pet Lily yes Anna I used to have a goldfish \nwhen I was younger but it died after a year oh I'm sorry to hear that goldfish \nAre Lovely Pets they are a name mine Sunny because of its bright color that's \na cute name I've always wanted to have a fish but I never got around to it maybe \nyou should consider getting one they're easy to take care of and they're peaceful to \nwatch I justes might do that any tips for a beginner make sure to clean the tank regularly \nand don't overfeed them thanks for the advice Lily I'll keep that in \n[Music] mind you should never \nYou should never lie \nlie did you tell Jake that I was the one who broke his guitar why would you say \nthat I I thought I saw you near it and then it broke I just \nassumed Bella that's not fair I would never touch Jake's guitar without his \npermission I'm sorry Anna I shouldn't have jumped to conclusions I should have \nasked you first you should never lie Bella trust is fragile once broken it's \nhard to mend I know I'm so sorry it won't happen \nagain it's not just about the guitar it's about being truthful with each other you're right I'll make it up up to \nyou and Jake thank you Bella honesty is the best \npolicy it's a big deal to Tom I \nIt's a big deal to Tom, I think \nthink why did Tom look so upset oh you didn't hear someone made a \njoke about his recent artwork but it was just a joke right why would he take it to \nheart art is Tom's passion when someone mocks it even in just it's like a direct \nblow to him it's a big deal to Tom I think I had \nno idea I feel so bad for laughing along I think you should talk to him \ncomfort him maybe who would mean a lot to him you're right I'll do that and \nclear the air that's a good decision Lisa epy goes a long way \n[Music] \nWe are completely in love \nwe are completely in \nlove Anna have you noticed how close Mock and Clara have gotten \nrecently yes I have every time I see them they're together it's quite obvious something's \ngoing on I overheard Mark talking to John yesterday he said we are completely in \nlove me and claraa can you believe that oh my God \nthat's so sudden they've only known each other for a couple of months love can be so unpredictable Anna \nmaybe they just connected on a deeper level I just hope they're not rushing into things love is beautiful but they \nshould be cautious me too Anna only time will \ntell yes let's just wish them the best \n[Music] does she live in \nDoes she live in Paris? \nParis have you heard about Sarah lately not really last I heard she was \ntraveling around Europe why I came across a postcard from her at the office \nit had an Eiffel Tower on it oh does she live in Paris now that's \nwhat I'm trying to figure out the postcard was vague maybe she's just traveling there \nParis is a dream for many after all yes but the message on the postcard \nsaid New Beginnings it made me wonder interesting let's call us \nsometime and catch up definitely I miss her we should plan \na visit if she's really in Paris I'll greed it would be lovely to see the city and our dear friend \nagain it's so \nIt's so crowded

sorry I I didn't expect it to \nbe this packed but let's try to find a seat I should have just stayed home and read \nmy book I hate noisy places like this come on M let's give it a chance \nmaybe the coffee here is incredible I just don't understand why everyone wants to come to a place when \nyou can't even hear yourself think it's the trend I guess people love \nnew places especially ones that everyone is talking about Trends are overrated \ngive me a quiet place with good coffee any day I promise next time we'll go to \nyour favorite quiet [Music] \nCafe I've made a list of foods that I can [Music] \nI've made a list of foods that I can't eat \neat hey we're planning dinner tonight at the new Italian restaurant on to \ncome actually Mike I have a list of foods I can't eat I'm not sure if I can \njoin what happened Anna did you develop allergies or something yes after that incident last \nmonth the doctor advised me to avoid certain foods oh I remember you had a severe \nreaction at Peter's party it was really scary I don't want that to happen ever again so I'm taking \nall precautions now I completely understand we can \nchoose another restaurant or just hang out
