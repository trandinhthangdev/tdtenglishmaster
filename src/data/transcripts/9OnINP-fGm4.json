different colors \nthat is very unique i've never seen such a combination before thank you \noh my god are all of those books where did you get so many \ni actually read a lot so i asked the interior designer to put the biggest bookcase she could find in here to fit \nall my books it took three people to carry it inside from the car \nthat is heavy what about this carpet why did you choose this pattern \nit is different isn't it i thought this checkered pattern would add an interesting point to the room \nit really does and it goes well with the chairs in the corner as well i'm glad \nyou noticed that it also matches the curtains oh yes i see it \nwhat about the walls why did you use wallpaper instead of paint \nit's because i like changing the walls color often and i think that it's easier with wallpaper \nby the way do you guys want to watch some tv let's do it is this the television you \nbought second hand yes that's it i'm very happy with it since i got it for a cheap price \nit also comes with these speakers which sound great lucky you i'm on the market for one but \ni haven't had any luck you'll find one can you pass me the teapot in that cupboard \nwhich shelf is it

a bit uncomfortable do you guys want smoothies i want to try \nout my new blender sure do you need any help can you get me \nthe ice cream from the refrigerator and a spoon and a knife from that drawer it would be very helpful \ni got you do we need to clean the blender jug first oh yeah we should get \nme the dish soap as well here you go can i have a look around while you make \nthis movies sure go ahead wow you really have every kitchen \nappliance in here tea maker toaster kettle mixer stove \noven microwave i know right he has so many things i especially love \nthe color of the cabinets though so classy be careful of the range hood it is \ninstalled lower than i would like it to be do you call that a range hood \nit's a cooker hood i totally forgot you're from the uk \nmartha we call it a range hood here in the us whatever you say \nhey where can i throw out this trash in that petal bin in the corner of the room \nnice petal bins are so useful you don't have to

mine is even worse \nwhat a huge bed rick haha yes i love my sleep so i invested \nin a king-sized one hmm it's not good to put a mirror opposite \nthe bed i don't believe that i like the look of it with the bright lights it makes the \nroom look so much bigger that's true and what is in this chest of drawers \njust my clothes in a few paintings i did a while ago why don't you hang them up \ni already have these pictures so i don't have space on the walls for them oh you're right \ncan we see ensuite bathroom as well you can but there isn't much to see just \na shower a bathtub a sink and a toilet well then let's go back to the living \nbathtub \nroom [Music] [Applause] \nyou guys should come over often i have a grill outside we can have a barbecue party that's a good idea \nwhere can i park my car around here though oh you can put it in my garage i haven't \nbought my own car yet i'm in okay that's a deal \n[Music] \nTALKING ABOUT A PARTY \ntalking about a party beth and tim are about to celebrate \nanne's birthday party at the weekend watch the video and know how to prepare \nto have a happy birthday party hey tim \nhow often do you go to parties well i go to most of the parties that \ni'm invited to but when i'm busy or if it's a school night i'll stay home \nwhy did you ask do you need any help well anne invited me to her \nbirthday party this weekend i'm free so i agreed and i only really \nwant to go but i've never gone to any party before \nreally then it's about time you go out and experience life \nso how do we start first of all i don't know what to wear \ni have a prom dress but i'm afraid it might be too formal \nyou're right we are planning to have an outdoor barbecue party so a prom dress is \ninappropriate it's too inconvenient \nthen what should i wear well you can't dress casually since it's \na party after all so i think a sophisticated blouse and skirt would be perfect \nif you want to i can come to your house before we go to the party to help you prepare \ni would love that thank you all right next what should i get as a \npresent for anne i'm not close to her so i really don't know what she likes \nhmm you can buy her some type of plushie toy perhaps \ntim ann isn't a five-year-old kid but girls still like it when they're \ngiven plushies even you like it too yes but carla is getting a present for \nanne not me well she is really into plants \noh but i don't think i have enough money to get her a plant \nwell then how about a book about plants or gardening i think she will love it \nyes that sounds reasonable thanks for the suggestion beth anything else \num what usually happens at parties like these i'm afraid i might be a little \nawkward and lost some parties can be very chaotic but \nthis is a birthday party and ann only invited a limited amount of people since her parents are there too \nyou only have to come have a drink talk to people and wait until they bring out the cake \nafter the birthday ceremony it's time to dance and just have a great time \nsounds fun i'll be looking forward to it i have to go now see you guys at the \nparty see you [Music] \n[Applause] okay now we have to discuss organizing anne's \nbirthday party okay so we all agreed that it will be an \noutdoor barbecue party right yes all right about the food what are we \ngoing to prepare beth you are the best cook we have do you \nhave any recommendations well i'm thinking pork kebabs \nwe can chop up pork bell peppers and cherry tomatoes put them through sticks \nand roast them it's convenient delicious and filling too \nthat's a great idea anything else chicken wings and sausages might be \ngreat i mean who doesn't love them right and i recommend bacon and beef steak \nwe should also have some more vegetables other than peppers and tomatoes from the kebabs \nokay i'll add those to the menu for vegetables are you all okay with cucumber celery \nand some salad you can bring some corn to grill \nall right that's it for the menu ann said that her parents will prepare the drinks to make sure we don't consume \nanything with alcohol so we don't need to worry about that great \nso what about decorations me and tim \nkind of had a design here we drew it out you guys can take a look \nwow it looks great you really put your effort into this \ndecorating is what i do best but thank you so \nafter we're done discussing the two of us will go to walmart to get some decorations \nis that okay yes of course then i'll take care of the cake \ni still have some work to do so unfortunately i can't bake it myself even though i really want to \ni guess i will just order it somewhere don't forget the candles \nhaha thanks for reminding me but i won't candles are important \ni think that's everything we need to take care of anne's parents will prepare the rest \nso what time should we arrive at her house to help with preparing the party starts at seven we have quite \na lot of things to do so let's be there before 5. does everyone agree \nabsolutely yes [Music] \nbella hello oh hello carla god it's been a while \ni haven't seen you since we finished the basic chemistry class don't be over dramatic bella it's only \nbeen a week that's a long time for me \num do you have a minute i just want to ask you something sure go ahead \nwell ann invited me to her birthday this weekend and \nyou mean annabelle johnson [Music] yes that's her she told me that i can \nbring someone along so can you come with me to the party i've never been to a real party before \nand i don't want to feel lost wait you have literally never gone to a party \never i know it's hard to believe but yes \noh dear you really need to learn to enjoy life more of course i'll come with you \ni know anne but we've never officially met maybe this could be a chance i've always \nadmired her thank you so much well tim told me that we can't dress \ncasual but don't be too formal don't worry i know how to dress up for \nparties like this oh and also beth mentioned something about \ndancing i'm a little bit worried about that i don't know how to dance \nit's a party carla not a talent show dancing is simply just feeling the music \nand doing whatever you want not everyone at the party knows how to \ndance i don't know either so relax no one is going to judge you \nwell i'm relieved to hear that i'm afraid that i was going to be a complete joke on the dance floor \nso what time does the party start it's at seven \nyou don't have a car right no i don't then i'll come and pick you up i'll \narrive at your house by 6 30. is that okay with you i think it's fine \ncool we're going to have a very good time i hope we will \nnow that i'm also invited i think i should go look for a present do you want to come with me \nof course let's go [Music] \nthanks for watching don't forget to like share comment on my video \nplease subscribe to learn english with jessica channel to watch more helpful \nvideos
