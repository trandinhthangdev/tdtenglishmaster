\noutside of the interview \nroom Tom was excitedly waiting for his \nturn to interview for the job he had \nlong desired a software \ndeveloper the company had an amazing \nreputation in the \nfield Tom was so eager for the \ninterview \nuntil well well well look who's here \nisn't this Tom the \nAirhead hi \nDerek oh Tom I can't believe they even \nconsidered you for this role software \ndevelopment requires real skills you \nknow are you sure that you're in the \nright \nplace don't get your hopes up this \nposition is \nmine remember who you are you are \nnobody you should stand up and go home \nnow \nTom didn't want to argue with Derek but \ndeep down he felt \nuncomfortable the interviewer opened the \ndoor and called the next \nperson Derek quickly stood up while Tom \nwas sitting still as if in a \ntrance Derek whispered in Tom's \near just stay out of my way \nloser then Derek headed into the \ninterview room leaving Tom behind with \nhis \nthoughts and a a fleeting moment Tom \nfound himself immersed in the memories \nof days gone \nby Tom endured Derrick's teasing \nthroughout high \n[Music] \nschool he remembered every moment when \nDerek made him feel small and \ninsignificant causing him to lose \nconfidence Tom had an incredibly tough \ntime during those \nyears it took a long time for him to \novercome the insecurities that Derrik \nhad \ncaused just when Tom started feeling \nmore confident in himself he encountered \nDerek \nagain that same voice that same attitude \nhaunted Tom once \nmore just as Tom was immersed in these \nthoughts he was suddenly called for the \ninterview entering the room he was so \nnervous and worried this made him \nstumble and feel empty \nheaded good afternoon Tom thank you for \ncoming in \ntoday I'm Cindy and I'll be conducting \nyour interview today can you tell me a \nlittle about \nyourself \nuh sure \nwell my name's Tom I've worked in a few \ndifferent \nplaces and you know learn some stuff \nalong the

as time goes \non do you have any questions for \nme um \nno no thank you for sharing Tom we will \nconsider all candidates and get in touch \n[Music] \nlater a few days later Tom was informed \nthat he had not met their expectations \nfor the \nposition Cindy expressed to Tom that he \ncould try again in the future and what \nmade Tom even sadder was when he found \nout that Derek got the \nposition with a heavy heart Tom went to \nhis girlfriend to find some \ncomfort Tom was sitting on his \ngirlfriend's sofa all he needed right \nthen was some comfort and a \nhug Linda his girlfriend came and sat \nnext to him \nare you \nokay I didn't get the \njob seriously Tom what \nhappened that guy who used to bully me \nin high school got \nit you mean \nDerek \nyes you must have messed something \nup and Derek he must have handled it \nbetter Linda I thought you'd be here for \nme I'm just saying you should be as \nstrong and confident as \nDerek it hurts you're just criticizing \nand comparing \nme whatever Tom it's the \ntruth I'm tired of disappointment I need \ntime to think about \nus don't contact me during this \ntime wait Li \nyou can't do this to \nme I need to go now you should go home \nand have some sleep or whatever you want \nto \n[Music] \ndo with a shattered heart Tom walked \ninto a \nbar he ordered a strong \n[Music] \ncocktail as Tom was enjoying his drink \nhe noticed a girl approaching \nhim it was Cindy the person who had \ninterviewed \nhim Tom isn't \nit yeah it's me hi \nCindy do you know why I remember \nyou because I was a \nloser no you seem really capable your \nexperience and background were \ngood but the way you answered the \nquestions seemed so weird and amateur \nwhat's \nwrong Tom told Cindy what happened that \nday he confided in Cindy like two \nfriends and told Cindy how much he loved \nthe job as a software \ndeveloper I wanted to be honest with you \nabout your interview your knowledge is \nsolid but your confidence seemed to \nwaver you struggled with answering \nquestions yeah I know I was really \nnervous \nI understand but I believe in your \npotential let me share something with \nyou what is \nit I had really hoped that you would be \nthe one who got the job that \nday oh really why is \nthat well when it comes to Derek he's \nquite arrogant I mean he does have some \nskills but his
