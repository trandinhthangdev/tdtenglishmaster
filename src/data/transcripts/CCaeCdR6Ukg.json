participate in cooking \nno sarah i hate cooking \nwhy \nluna i feel like cooking is a waste of \ntime \ni can buy food from this store and eat \nit well \nso you never cook at home right \nsometimes when i have free time \ni'm quite busy with work and usually \ncome home late i don't have time to \nprepare dinner for myself \npoor you but you know what luna \nyou should still cook it for yourself \nit'll save you money and you can take \ncontrol of what you're eating \nbut how do that sarah i'm too busy \nmaybe you should find a new roommate \nshe'll help you prepare the meal \nor you can talk to your boss \nand ask him to allow you to go home \nearly to prepare a meal you can continue \nto work after eating \ngreat idea sarah i'll talk to my boss \nfirst \ngood luna i believe you'll enjoy eating \nthe food you make yourself \nyou can also find new dishes on the \ninternet and try to make them \nit will be very interesting \nokay luna thanks for your advice \nyou're welcome my friend \n[Music] \nhi maria it's isabella \nhi isabella what's up \nthere is a new pub downtown and i wanted \nto ask if you want to go check it out \nwith me tonight \na pup \nsure but i haven't been to a pub before \ni'm kinda nervous \ndon't worry \ni got you and the bartender will help \nyou choose the drink that fits your \ntaste \nso i'll meet you there at 8pm is that \nfine \nsure see you then bye \nlater \n[Music] \nhey maria over here \nhi girls what can i help you with today \nhi i don't know what to order can you \nhelp me with the menu \nsure here \ni highly recommend this drink whiskey \nsour \nit's a bourbon based cocktail a \ncombination of whiskey sugar and lemon \njuice \nit's my all-time favorite \ni want something fresher \nhow about a mojito \nthis classic cuban cocktail features a \ncombination of citrus sweet and mint \nflavors to control the strong taste of \nrum \nbut i think it especially is enjoyable \non a hot summer day at the pool \nmaria how about long island iced tea \nyou like iced tea right \nfor those who love iced tea this long \nisland-based drink is even better \nit may look like a regular glass of tea \nbut a mixture of vodka rum tequila gin \ntriple sec and cola can give it a strong \ntaste \nor you can try lemon drop \nit is the perfect combination of sweet \nand sour garnished with a fun and \ncolorful lemon twist \nand sugar around the rim of the glass \nfor extra sweetness \nit's my favorite drink \nthey both sound tasty \nbut \ni want to see other options \nwhat does this bloody mary taste like \nthis popular and complex beverage can be \nas spicy or mild as you like \nflavorings such as tabasco sauce \nworcestershire sauce and cayenne pepper \ncan be added according to your preferred \ntaste \nthat's interesting i think i will try \nthe spicy bloody mary please \ngreat choice you will love it \nthis is fun right we should do this more \noften \nsure i'll try to other drinks next time \n[Music]
