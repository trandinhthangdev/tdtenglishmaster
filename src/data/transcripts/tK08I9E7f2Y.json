much Tom \nyou're welcome and this is the present that Lisa and I have prepared for you \noh this shirt is so beautiful thanks very much I will wear it out tomorrow \nglad you like it all right Mr Brad these are two present boxes that Jasmine and I have prepared \nwow what are these two boxes can you guess \nwell I do not know open them you will definitely love them \noh my God how do you know I like to drink apple juice \nit's a secret even these canned foods all my favorite Brands I love to eat canned salmon and \nbeef glad you like these presents okay guys after glass is over we'll all \nhave a small party that's awesome well let's start class \nokay who remembers what we talked about last class okay Duke \nwe learned about gerunds and infinitives in English [Music] very good what are gerunds and \ninfinitives with examples a gerund is a verb that ends in ing and \nis used as a noun walking traveling voting \nan infinitive is the base form of a verb preceded by two such as to walk to \ntravel to vote gerunds and infinitives can be used as the subject the complement or the object \nof a sentence exactly is there a case in which verbs are \nfollowed by a two infinitive or Ing and the difference in meaning is often small \nhate like love and prefer can be followed either by ing or a too \ninfinitive good job alright let's check your homework have you done all your homework \nyet sorry Mr Brad I forgot to do my homework \ndoes anyone else forget to do homework sorry Mr Brad yesterday we had a small \nparty and we all forgot to do our homework I feel very disappointed \non behalf of the class I deeply apologize Mr Brad [Music] since all of you haven't done your \nhomework I will let you stay here after class to finish it \nno Mr Brad the class will end at 5 PM instead of 4 \npm as usual okay yes \nthen to ensure the quality of today's lesson I will collect everyone's cell phones including mine \noh no Duke but these phones the locker in the hallway \nokay Mr Brad [Music] \nforeign \nwell I heard someone at the door do you hear that yes I do hear it \nit's so strange let me see oh my God \nwhat's wrong Mr Brad why is the door locked what the door is locked \nyes Sid Sid are you out there Mr Brad everyone seems to have left what \nmust we do now God we're gonna be locked up here \nwe don't even have a phone to contact other people calm down everyone we will find a way \nout but The English Center will be open on Monday does that mean we'll be locked up \nhere for three days [Music] surely my mother would be extremely worried \nlisten listen everyone we need to be calm we have to think of a way out \nwhat should we do now how to get out of a locked room should we break the door \nbut we have nothing to break the door you're right or maybe we jump from the window \nwhat are you crazy do you know what floor we are on fourth floor so what \njumping off is dangerous falling from a four-story window can cause death or Serious injury or break your leg \nit's hard to find a way out yeah there is no other way \nI don't want to be locked up here we will starve no we have food and drink remember \nJasmine and Duke's presents we have me a box of apple juice owned a \nbox of a canned foods oh that's right I remember very lucky indeed \nat least we'll have enough food until Monday all right in the meantime do you guys \nwant to play a game sure sure I love playing games me too \nwhat are we going to play word matching game can you explain in more detail \nokay this is a game to review old lessons for example if I said avoid you \nwould have to answer verb ing or to verb and then give an example do you guys \nunderstand the game [Music] okay the first word is enjoy \nenjoy is followed by verb ing and my example is \nI always enjoy cooking well done all right the next word is \npromise the verb is followed by an infinitive I promise to do my homework \nright well another word is try can be followed by an infinitive form \nno try followed by verb ing well both are correct \nwhy Mr Brad is a special verb in English because it \ncan be followed with either a gerund or infinitive however the meaning changes \nthe meaning changes yes let's see two examples I tried \ncalling her but the line was busy and I tried to call her but the line was busy \nI tried calling means he thought phoning might be the way to do it I tried to \ncall means he made an effort well so the difference is very small \ntry doing is experimenting with doing try to do is about making an effort \noh I get it now who wants to sing a song \n[Music] \nit's eight o'clock now yeah all of our plans failed \nI plan to have dinner with my girlfriend tonight this weekend we also arranged to go on a picnic together but now I'm stuck here \nthis weekend is my niece's birthday I have prepared many presents for her \nI plan to go out with friends and I plan to go shopping \nand now we're stuck here that's bad Mr Brad \nyes what's up I need to go to the toilet oh no what do we do now \nthe problem to solve everyone be quiet I heard Footsteps in the hallway \nreally yeah there's definitely someone out there \nwe are in here Little Bus \nhelp us why are you here \nyou locked the door and accidentally locked us oh I deeply apologize for locking the \ndoor I think classes are over well we study an extra hour \noh well let's Sid why do you go back to the center \nwell I forgot to bring home the lunchbox [Music] anyway luckily you opened the door for \nus all right everyone let's go home have a nice weekend everyone \nMr Brad happy birthday to you thank you goodbye \ngoodbye now I will check the other rooms to see \nif anyone is locked inside okay \noh Sid got my birthday present I'll go back to the classroom to get it \nokay okay \nall right let's go home what \noh no no no no Sid Sid Sid \n[Music] \nhave you ever made or received a surprise birthday party before in this \nvideo let's learn how to express the future with Will and going to while \nenjoying how Ace Luna and Luca celebrate a surprise party for their friends Mia \n[Music] \nguys Mia said that she would go home late tonight so we don't have to wait for her \npoor her she's been working very hard lately anyway do you guys intend to do this \nweekend no idea I'm going to sleep from morning till \nnight [Music] oh come on man you will waste your \nweekend let's do something else together hey I've just realized that tomorrow is \nMia's birthday wait what oh yeah you're right I almost forgot \nshould we celebrate a party for her yes why not \nwait but Mia also works on Saturday if so maybe we can celebrate a surprise \nbirthday hey I'll go with it yeah let's do it together \nwe need to make a detailed plan first do you guys want to make or buy a cake \nI think making a cake will be more meaningful I agree \nthen first we should go to the supermarket to find the ingredients \nwait we don't have any tools to make a cake all right so how about this \nLuna and Luca you guys will buy ingredients \nand I will go to the baking supplies section what kinds of supplies do you think \nwe'll need not sure do you have any idea \nwe already have an oven and enough bowls so I think you will have to buy a cake \npan a whisk and a mixer okay I remember it \nwe should also search for a cake recipe on the internet to make a list of ingredients as well \nsure thing apart from a cake I think we should decorate our house as well \nthen after buying the necessary things for making a cake we will go to the home decoration \nsection I think it will take about three hours \nto make a cake so how about I go home before you guys \nprepare the cake that's a great idea so Luca and I will stay in the \nsupermarket to look for decoration stuff Luna will go home first with the \ningredients and tools to make the cake right that's correct \nhey guys I want to buy flowers for Mia as well \nwill we have enough time to do so perhaps after leaving the supermarket \nace and I will go to the flower shop to schedule flower delivery \nwhat time does Mia often go home on Saturday she often leaves at 8am and comes back \nat 5 pm so Luna will make the cake and Ace and I \nwill decorate our living room then we will receive our bouquet at \naround 4 30 P.M and wait until Mia comes home to \nsurprise her great our plan is perfect \nwait guys Mia's company is near here so she always \ngoes home during lunch to eat with us let's call her and say that there will \nbe nobody home tomorrow oh sure \nhello Mia what's up Luna well I just want to say that none of us \nare going to stay at home tomorrow please don't go home at lunch okay \nall right got it when will you guys come back \nsure maybe late at night I see okay \n[Music] \nhave you finished making the cake Luna I'm preparing the frosting right now \nafter that I'm going to spread the frosting on the cake and then I'm done \nyou guys can decorate the cake with me if you want that's cool \n[Music] \nhow is your decorating we're still working on it \nbut we are going to finish in 10 minutes it's almost done \nglad to hear that now how should we surprise her \nI will stand near the door to check whether Mia's driving home or not \nwhen she's near I'm going to make a signal okay so Luna and I are going to wait at \nthe front door and when Mia is going to open the door we will all together say \nhappy birthday got it [Music] \nguys be ready she's coming [Music] \nsurprise happy birthday what oh my God what is that \ndid you do that for me Mia thank you so much \nwait

waiting for you here's your flowers Mia \nyou will also have a lot of surprising presents for you today is not my birthday guys \nit's the 30th of May not the 13th oh gosh \noh my what it was my fault I remember your birthday \nwrong no worries Ace neither do we remember it \nwe all thought that today was your birthday so we were going to prepare a lot of \nthings for you we made the cake decorated the house \nbought the flowers and waited at the front door and we even lied to you that we were not \ngoing to stay at home today come on guys you guys make me cry \nbut why don't worry I want to cry because you \nguys were so considerate I agree your friend is really thoughtful \nMia you are lucky to have good friends like them \nthank you sir we hope you are not angry at us please \ndon't fire Mia after that sir [Music] what are you guys saying \nI'm not going to fire her because her friends got her birthday wrong honestly I was also surprised and a \nlittle happy thank you for that sir hey guys \nhow about we celebrate Mia's boss's birthday today yeah I'm also thinking about that \nand then we can celebrate Mia's birthday on the 30th fantastic \nI'm going to change the name on the birthday cake may I know your name sir \noh you guys do not have to do this for me but please call me Mr John in case you \nwant to know happy birthday Mr John \nthank you so much I will treasure this birthday for the \nrest of my life [Music] \nwill is often used in a similar way to be going to will is used when we are talking about \nsomething with absolute certainty be going to is used when we want to \nemphasize our decision or the evidence in the present \none be going to subject plus be going to plus verb \nuse when you intend to do something in the present I'm going to sleep from morning till \nnight none of us are going to stay at home tomorrow \nI'm going to spread the frosting on the cake use when you want to make predictions \nwe are going to finish in 10 minutes two \nwill subject plus will plus verb \nuse when you think you certain do or intend to do something in the near \nfuture Luna and Luca you guys will buy ingredients \nI will go to the baking supplies section use when you want to make predictions \nyou will waste your weekend making a cake will be more meaningful \nI think you will have to buy a cake pan I think it will take about three hours \nto make the cake promises I will treasure this birthday for the \nrest of my life thanks for watching don't forget to like \nshare comment on my video please subscribe to learn English with \nJessica
