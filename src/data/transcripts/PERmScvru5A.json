them \nat any time in the forest \nthen why did they go there \njust like you they went there they \npromised each other \nthat they would remain united at any \ncost \nsuddenly they saw a bear approaching \nthem \nthen what happened one of the friends \nat once climbed a nearby tree \nwhat about the other one the other one \ndid \nnot know how to climb then what happened \nbeing led by his common sense he lay \ndown \non the ground and pretended to be a dead \nman \nthe bear came near the boy it smelled \nnear his ear and slowly left the place \nsuper then what happened \nnow the boy came down and asked \nwhat did the bear say the boy replied \nthat the bear advised him \nnot to believe a false friend \nbeing in a new situation with a new \nfriend \nis indeed exciting but beware of the \npeople who are just \nposing as your friend in the same way \nyou have to be supported of your friends \nby standing by them \nin any situation thank you mom for this \nvaluable moral
