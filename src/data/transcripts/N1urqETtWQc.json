\nit hey Andy what's on your mind I'm a bit hesitant about taking the new job \noffer it seems like a big step I understand your concerns but remember \nthere are a thousand reasons to do it if feels like such a risk and I'm comfortable where I am now I get that \nbut growth often comes from stepping out of our comfort zones think about all the new skills \nyou'll learn and the opportunities it could open up true but what if I'm not ready for \nthe challenges it brings you won't know until you try embrace the chance to learn and \ngrow remember every successful Journey starts with a single step you're right I've always admired \nthose who take bold steps in their careers maybe it's time for me to take one too that's the spirit believe in \nyourself and you'll find your own reasons for making this move you've got this all right you're convincing me it \nreally is worth a try exactly good luck thanks \n[Music] Julia taking a risk can be \nrewarding \nhey have you ever thought about taking a risk well it depends what kind of risk \nare you talking about I mean stepping out of our comfort zones and trying something new taking a risk can be \nrewarding H I'm not sure risks often come with uncertainties and potential \nfailures true but they also offer opportunities for growth and \nsuccess remember when we started that small project together it was risky but \nit turned out to be one of our greatest achievements that's a fair point I guess \ntaking calculated risks can lead to unexpected outcomes and personal development so what do you say shall we \nembrace the unknown and see where it takes us all right let's give it a \nshot what is your current \naddress hey I realized I don't have your current address what is your current \naddress my current address is 123 Elm Street Apartment \n4B have you moved recently yeah I I moved about 2 months \nago it's a nice place closer to my workplace that's \nconvenient and speaking of addresses has yours changed \nrecently actually yes I moved to a new neighborhood last week it's \n456 Oak Avenue got it thanks for letting me know \nnew addresses can be a bit tricky to keep track of sometimes absolutely but it's important for \nstaying \nconnected the future is full of \nHope hey there how's everything going honestly I've been feeling a bit \ndown lately the world seems so uncertain right now \nI understand what you mean but remember the future is full of hope we may face \nchallenges but we also have endless possibilities ahead it's just hard to see beyond the \ncurrent chaos sometimes I completely get that but if \nwe focus on the negatives we might miss out on opportunities for growth and positive \nchange I guess it's important to focus on finding Solutions and being open to new \nideas absolutely together we can shape the future we \nwant keep working towards making a difference in our own lives and the world around \nus you're right the future is full of \nhope that is the wrong [Music] \nanswer do you want to play a game which \ngame answer the question okay go ahead do you know the \ncapital of France sure it's Berlin actually that is the wrong answer \nthe correct answer

sure \nI remember reading something about it but I can't recall the exact details have you tried looking it up in \nyour notes I did but couldn't find anything specific maybe we should ask the teacher

high have \nyou considered buying a used car a used car can be a good deal and \nsave you a lot of money really I've always been hesitant about used \ncars I worry about their condition I understand your concern but \nif you do your research and buy from a reputable dealer you can find a well-maintained \nused car that's reliable and affordable that's true I guess I should \nlook into it more a

communicate openly and respectfully you're right let's focus on \nlistening to each other rather than trying to prove who's right or wrong yeah we can find common ground and \nwork through our differences together that's a great approach we should prioritize finding \nSolutions instead of winning arguments absolutely we can overcome these \nchallenges and grow stronger as a \ncouple let's

materials just the basics why I'm trying \nto pick a fabric for my new dress what clothing options do you have \nsilk cotton and pol polyester silk is fancy isn't \nit yes but it's also delicate and hard to maintain how about \ncotton it's comfy but it wrinkles easily and \npolyester it's durable but not as breathable sounds like a tough \nchoice I want something that looks good and feels good maybe a blend like cotton \nsilk that could work it's soft and less wrinkly but will it \nlast not as long as polyester for sure you might have to compromise \nsomewhere I guess so maybe I'll get two dresses instead that's the spirit double the \nfun and Double the Trouble deciding you'll figure it out you always \ndo thanks for the vot of confidence anytime let's go fabric \nshopping oh you're

there \nare I know right choosing sheets should be simple what's the difference between \nEgyptian cotton and regular cotton I think Egyptian cotton is \nsupposed to be softer but there's like a $200 difference is it really that much \nbetter maybe it's one of those luxury things luxury or not I just want \nsomething that feels nice what about thread count they say the higher the \nbetter do you really believe that I can't even tell the difference not sure but let's check out \nthese 800 thread count ones they do feel pretty nice but look at this \npattern that's colorful very loud too \nmuch for me I prefer something more subtle here's a nice one simple High thread \ncounts and soft and it's on sale that's my favorite \nfeature it's like it was made for you don't jinx it let's grab it before \nsomeone else does do we need matching pillowcases might as well it's all about \nthe aesthetic right we're going to have the best dressed bed in \ntown as long as it's comfortable I'm happy
