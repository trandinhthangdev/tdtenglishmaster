they're from a woman but why \ndid you bring a strange woman with you \nin your car she was not a strange woman \nshe's Linda from the marketing \ndepartment her car has been getting \nrepaired in the

chandelier earrings for \nfemales luckily she didn't ask anything \nelse and you been wearing them for a \ncouple of days without any notice \nyes until you discovered and asked me \nall right all
