    "transcript": "[Music] \nhello everyone I'm Jessica and welcome to learning English with Jessica in this video we're going to \nlisten and practice our English through many different conversations you can play it again \nrepeatedly while engaging in other activities to help your brain memorize the \nlanguage be patient and you will swiftly improve your speaking and listening skills now let's jump right into the \nvideo H what should I do for the video this week shall I read some comments for \nnew ideas wow thank you guys for always supporting me I can see a lot of \ncomments about speaking skills a lot of people suggest that I should share some tips to speak \nEnglish some audiences said they could understand English but they couldn't communicate with the native speakers \nsome also said that they didn't feel confident when they talked because their pronunciation hadn't improved and some \neven shared that they always feel anxious about their speaking skills I can understand the problems \nthat you guys shared with me speaking English seems easy but it's actually one of the most difficult \nskills each person should have their own learning method to improve their English in today's video I will share \nsome tips to speak English fluently for beginners and I will give you some speaking practice \nexercises so let's watch until the end and improve your speaking with me number one don't be afraid to make \nmistakes let's have a look at this example first so can you tell me more about your \nfamily um well my family has four people \nand well so my father is you know \nactually my mom works um I don't know how to say that word \nbut how can I say OMG I really don't know how to talk \nabout my family will she laugh at me all right guys do you have the same problems \nas this guy for beginners we tend to overthink that we will make a lot of mistakes while speaking and we are \nafraid that other people will judge us we are worried we will use the wrong vocabulary or make grammatical errors \nbut guys let's keep calm and take a deep breath sometimes even native speakers \nmake mistakes no one can be perfect the first thing to put in your \nmind is if you want to improve speaking you need to speak you can speak to yourself or find a friend to practice \nwith especially someone who has the same learning goal as you practice practice \nand practice always remember that practice makes perfect number two learn new words and \nuse what you've learned immediately if you learn new vocabulary \nevery day that's a good thing however taking notes is not \nenough if you fail to apply the vocabulary into your daily life you will not remember any words in the long \nterm I suggest that you should make a sentence or an example with every word that you've learned for example one of \ntoday's new words is animal now let's create your own sentence with this word let me do it \nfirst I like a lot of animals such as rabbits penguins and lions how about you can you make your \nown sentence please share it in the comment section don't just stop at creating \nexamples let's try to think and speak in English you have to use the word you learned in your daily life I've made a \nlot of videos on how to think and speak in English you can find it \nhere or click on my YouTube channel to search for it with this method you will \nknow how to use the vocabulary correctly try your best to practice speaking every \nday so that it will become your daily routine number three \nlistening the more you hear the easier it will be for you to speak better \nEnglish have you ever heard of the shadowing method okay so first do you guys know \nwhat shadow means it's the dark shape on a Surface right let's imagine that you \nare a shadow of the native speakers you can start with singing songs in English or try to repeat the \ncharacter scripts in an English movie imagine that you are a singer or an actor and let let's see how far you can \ncopypaste the native speaker accent or their tone of voice as for me I usually watch my \nfavorite YouTube channels or listen to podcasts on Spotify whenever I have free \ntime while listening I also try to repeat their sentences so as to improve \nmy pronunciation I also feel much more confident than just simply looking up \nthe meaning and reading the words you can also practice listening through my channel Jessica \nI have a lot of videos to show you how to practice your speaking and listening skills you can find them here or click \non the channel to learn more all right I hope that you guys can learn some speaking tips from me now it's time to \npractice practice speaking \n[Music] English hey Mia what what are you \ndoing me I'm listening to music really what songs are you
