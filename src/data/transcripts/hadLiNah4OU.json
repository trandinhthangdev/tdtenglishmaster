\nI have something to tell all of you yes Mom \nas you've seen your Dad's health is getting worse he is old and weak and has a disease now \nhe probably won't live much longer everyone will be old and weak \nwhat do you mean mom I know that all of you have your own life and your own business \nbut at least in the last days of his life he'll be happy to have you visit and \ntalk to him please try to spend more time with your father and take care of him \nI really want to but you know I'm the director without me the whole office would be \nmessed up I always want to come back here but I'm a singer \nI'm very busy with shows next week I'll go to Paris again for a \nconcert you're busy too aren't you fine \ndon't worry Mom I'll arrange my schedule and visit dad every week \nprank that's so great as you know your father has a huge Farm \nthe farm is the fruit of his life looks like the farm isn't efficient \nno Huey this Farm produces enough corn each year to fill one and a half million boxes of \ncorn flakes and enough wheat to bake 1 million loaves of bread \nwhat is that true yes but your dad won't be able to take \ncare of this Farm anymore he'll probably hand it over to you \nwe rarely visit so we had no idea the farm is so profitable \nFrank you're right but that was in the past from now on I promise to visit you and \nDad more often mom really yes Mom you have my word \nyou know how much I love him hey Max it's Billy please reschedule my \nconcert in Paris I have an important person to take care of \nmom I'll stay here we'll take good care of dad in the last days of his life \nthat's right nothing is more important than Dad right now thank you my sons \nfriends [Music] foreign [Music] \nwas so efficient me too that shocked me \nbut why did you postpone your concert no Huey there's no concerts at all \nI haven't had any shows lately my business is operating at a loss \nit's been really hard recently don't worry if we inherit this Farm \nwe'll have a lot of money you're right if inherited I'll sell it immediately to \ncover the loss and continue to invest if inherited I'll buy a house or a car \nand party every day how about you Frank I just want to take care of dad and hope \nhe gets well soon are you serious he's very weak right now I don't think \nif the worst happens I just want to continue to develop the farm because \nit's his passion you're so silly do you want to become a farmer \noh poor Frank ignore him [Music] \nI don't want Huey and Billy to inherit the farm oh Brad \nyou know Candace Huey and Billy spend money without thinking \nHuey works hard but his personality is too cocky \nhe easily rests on his laurels I know \nand Billy he is a Playboy partying all night and \nsquandering money [Music] if I give all my assets to you here \nBilly if they become heirs they will destroy everything \ndon't worry Brad we still have Frank you're right \nFrank is a bit clumsy and shy but affectionate \nand intelligent he said that he will develop the farm because it's your passion \nyes he's a good boy he knows how to observe and solve \nproblems smoothly I want Frank to inherit the farm \nbut you just can't hand over all of the things to Frank because it's not fair \nYuri and Billy won't be satisfied with that yes you're right again \nwhat should we do I have an idea \nwhat is it Candace please go to their rooms and \ntell them I want to meet them at the barn tomorrow [Music] \ndad your health is still weak we can talk in your room that's right \nwhy did you call us out here it's true my health gets weaker day by \nday so today I want to choose only one person to be the heir to this Farm \none out of the three of us yes so I have to fight with my brothers to \nbe chosen as the error I don't want to fight anyone \ndon't worry Frank you won't have to fight \nI'll become the heir anyway take a look around this Barn \nwhat do you want us to do dad I will give my farm to whoever finds \nanything that can fill the whole Barn what \ndad are you serious yes I am serious if you want to own this Farm start \nlooking for anything that can fill this place okay it's easy Dad I'll be back soon \nwhat can fill this Barn oh I hate puzzles brainstorm Billy \nokay I need to find something that can help go [Music] \nwhy are you still standing here Frank I think I know what I need \nwhen you were young you often accompanied me to the farm planting and \nwatering plants yeah I remember that \ndo you like those jobs I love them but Dad I'd rather you get well than I \ninherit this Farm if possible I would like to develop this place with you \nso let's win okay Dad I'll be right back \ngood luck son \nhi Dad Mom I'm back what did you bring back \nall of my wood will fill that Barn oh no my wood can't fill the barn \nso you have lost I don't think Billy or Frank can do this \nlet's see I'm back hey is the correct answer \n[Music] Silly Billy \nthe hay is not the answer either Frank won't find the answer we should \nchange the question [Music] \nFrank what will you do with that silly boy \nwhat do you have Frank the light is the answer dad \nI just need to light this up then it will cover the entire Barn \nI like your idea he's really smart honey \nnow I will hang it up here [Music] \nhurry up get out of there [Music] \nwe need to put out the fire it's too late now \nI should have given the farm to your
