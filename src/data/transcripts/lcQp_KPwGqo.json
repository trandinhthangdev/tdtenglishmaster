    "transcript": "Intro \nhello everyone welcome to my English Channel I'm Jessica and today I have an \nexciting topic for you guys do you know that if you want to understand a joke you have to know not \nonly the language but also its culture geography and the ethics of that \nsociety and this video will help you explore the world of jokes anyway explaining a joke is like \ndissecting a frog you understand it better but the frog dies in the process \nenough introduction let's get [Music] \nConversation 1 \nstarted H I can't believe how hard that math test was today I think I \nfailed don't worry Alex I'm sure you aced it you're like a math \ngenius yeah Alex you're so smart I always have to ask you for help with my \nhomework well I try my best but let's not talk about math \nanymore it's giving me a headache okay then do you mind hearing this math joke I've just come up with go \non what is it well do you know what did the mean triangle St to the \ncircle no what you're pointless \nha haha wait wait I don't get it why is \nthat funny well Chris you see triangles have points but circles \ndon't pointless here is a homonym which also means a waste of time \nuseless oh I see that's pretty clever Tom all right here's another one for you \nguys why did the student eat his own work I have no idea \nwhy because his teacher told him it was a piece of cake \noh okay my turn did you know that 10 + 10 equal 11 \n+ 11 what that doesn't make sense how can they be \nequal it's true 10 + 10 is 20 and 11 + \n11 is 22 \noh I see 22 sounds like \n202 like 20 also you had me confused for a \nsecond yeah it's just a little moth joke oh I've got another one why was six \nafraid of seven I don't know why because 7 8 \n[Laughter] n ah I see it's funny because eight e i \ng HT sounds like eight at well I think we've laughed enough for \none day I'm hungry now yeah let's go to a restaurant near my \nhouse \nwell we've been waiting for the waiter for quite some time I hope they haven't forgotten about us actually today it is \nmore crowded than usual I didn't expect this sorry guys do you guys want to tell \nsome jokes to pass the time sure that sounds like a good idea \nwhat do you have why did the Scarecrow win an award I don't know \nwhy it was outstanding in its \nfield wait why oh I get it the answer to the joke \nis a hilarious pun when someone does an outstanding job \nthey win Awards and get promotions while the Scarecrow may be doing an excellent job the joke refers \nto its standing out in the field ah I feel like I'm slowly catching up \nwe're proud of you go thank you thank you okay I've also got a couple of jokes \nsure go ahead what do you call cheese that is not \nyours I don't know what do you call it Nao \ncheese That's a classic I never get tired of that one ah I get \nit nacho sounds like not your it's good but I've got something \nbetter want to hear a joke about pizza sure what is it never mind it's \ntoo cheesy I see what you did \nthere it's funny because Pizza can both be cheesy in flavor and cheesy in a \ncorny way wow exactly you got it Chris \nthis joke is made especially for you sure I'm all is did you order the fish and \nchips no I didn't why do you ask because you're a fish out of water \nwhen it comes to understanding jokes Tom that was \nterrible I know I know I couldn't resist \nha it's fine Alex that was actually pretty funny but I'm improving you guys \nshould really watch out all right we'll \nwait hey have you guys seen the name of this coffee shop what brutiful Cafe that's a good \none I like it too it's a play on be and \nBrew wow you really are improving aren't you maybe we should really watch out for \nyou ha I'm just getting started all right here's another joke \nfor you guys what is an army member's top \ndrink no idea what do they drink \nwater how about this how do you ask a dinosaur if he wants a drink I literally have no clue \nT-Rex that one's funny it's a pun on the dinosaur's name T-Rex and the word \nt right it's a silly joke but it's easy to remember I see okay I've got a joke \nmyself really tell us we're so excited to hear why does Peter Pan \nfly I don't know why because he never \nlands He Never Lands I'm pretty impressed Chris wait I have more hear me \nout what shoes do ninjas wear what \n[Music] sneakers you totally nailed that genius \nChris true I'm dying laughing now H thanks guys let's take a walk around a \nlake near my [Music] \nhouse it's really peaceful out here yeah I love coming out to this Lake \nit's so calming it really is and it seems like there are a lot of fish in the \nlake speaking of fish do you know what's the richest fish in the world I don't \nknow what is it a goldfish that's pretty good I never \nthought of it that way yeah it's a classic I love how simple yet clever it \nis I've got another one what do you call a fish with a tie I don't know what do you call it so \nfisticated good one but do you know what's the difference between a hippo and a \nZippo I don't know what one is really heavy and the other is a little \nlighter wow Chris you're on a roll today yes that's a complicated one \ninteresting pun a little lighter could mean a small device for starting fires or a small \namount that's less heavy the human derived from this joke comes from The Listener recognizing that \nthe joke has both of those meaning well I'm learning a lot from you \nguys let's talk about slang when talking with people in English you may find that native \nspeakers love using slang a lot that's why this lesson is very useful for you to learn some slang words \nand understand their meanings we're going to practice some exercises together the exercise sizes include Gap \nfilling and multiple choice questions and each conversation is followed by a lesson review so let's get \nstarted part one fill in the blanks there are three conversations \nthat have some missing slang listen to fill in the correct slang words that you \nhear after [Music] \nAfter work \nwork hey Amy you're home what's up \nJames gosh look at you you really need to catch some z's [Music] \nAmy I definitely do but before I kick back I need to send an \n[Music] email send an email just chill out first \nAmy \ntime's on our side no need dist stress I'll finish it in a hot minute \nokay \ndone cool do you want to grab some \ndinner sure let's go first we have catch some z's which means \nto sleep example all I want to do is go home and catch some \nz's next we have kick back which means to relax for example since we didn't have \nany homework today we kicked back and listened to music let's move to the next \none we have the verb to chill which is also very common it means to relax or to \ncalm someone down for example hey just chill man the exam is not \ntomorrow Last Friday \nLast Friday night \nNight good morning Lisa you look so lit at the party last \n[Music] night really thank you but I didn't see \nyou anywhere last night night I was at the grub counter and showing down on some good \nfood ah I see did you drink I did drink but luckily I wasn't \n[Music] slashed really how could you stay sober \nwhile everyone was all [Music] \nTanked no idea I guess I spent most of the time vibing with \n[Music] music oh yeah speaking of which the DJ \nlast night was off the \nchain I know right they should hire that guy for the next party \nabsolutely the next word will be lit when something is lit it's \namazing for example your dress is so lit tonight you can use this word to compliment \nsomeone next we have to be sosed and to be tanked they both mean to get \ndrunk I drank some wine but I didn't get sosed or everyone was completely tanked \nafter the party are two examples you can learn to use the words next we have off the chain it \nmeans extremely good for example we're going to show them this town is off the \nchain part two choose the best answer you will hear three conversations \nthat include a lot of slanging select the answers a b or c to \nchoose the suitable slang and complete the conversations Picnic \nPicnic day \nDay the weather today is picnic \nworthy couldn't agree more I'm glad that it's cloudy [Music] \n[Music] today yeah cloudy weather is straight \nfire it's not scorching hot or freezing cold perfect for a \npicnic \n[Music] let's Scout for a spot by the riverbank \n[Music] \nguys how about kicking it under this blossom tree \noh wow look at it gorgeous okay let's unfold our picnic \nblanket and get the grub \nready I'm really stooped since we could finally unwind after hard \nwork you're right \n[Music] \nthis short trip will help us recharge our batteries for the grind [Music] \nahead it straight fire is one of the new slang you should learn it's an expression to exclaim that \nsomething is appealing or thoroughly enjoyed you can use its straight fire this same way as it's \nlit for example The Rock concert was straight fire \nyesterday next we have stoed it means excited and very happy about \nsomething example we're really stoked about our new album our next word is \ngrind to make something into small pieces or a powder by pressing between hard \nServices example shall I grind a little black pepper over your \nsalad eating \nEating out \nout how's the food [Music] \nhoney it's insanely out of this world from the moment we stepped in I knew that this joint was legit \n[Music] \n[Music]  the vibe and the food everything's \ntotally on point I'm thrilled you're vibing with \n[Music] it \ndon't you know that your taste in restaurants is wicked awesome thanks one of my hobbies is to \nfind aesthetic restaurants and try all of \n[Music] \nthem what a give it a go man I dig that Spirit are you a fool now want to order \nanything \nelse I'm pretty much stuffed now let's go to the counter the bills on \nme come to the first words out of this world they mean extreme \ngood for example the food at that restaurant is out of this \nworld if you're tired of using the word perfect you can say on point \ninstead for example the food is totally on point that phrase describes how perfect \nor delicious the food is the next word we have is \ndig when it comes to slaying to dig here does not mean to dig the Garden or to dig a hole \nit actually means to like something very much for example I really dig Taylor \nSwift's latest album group \nGroup work \nwork shall we discuss the lecture this morning sure go \nahead so basically we learned about modern arts and traditional Arts I found \ncubism to be hella interesting I'm with you I really like \nhow we can observe different views of objectives all at \nonce I feel you but cubism is too out there for me I'll go with the classical \nones [Music] \nthey're way easier to absorb No [Music] \n[Music] Cap didn't you find them a little bit \nlame no I actually think that art should be presented in a simple way so that everyone can enjoy \nit I think both modern and traditional Arts have their own \nattractiveness the thing is we have to tell them apart it's our homework isn't \n[Music] \nit you're right let's get this work done \nlet's move on to the final word on our list we have the word out there it means unusual or \nextreme example he is a great agent because he isn't afraid to give the more out their acts a \ntry finally the last words on our list are no \ncap it's also a common slang that young people use a lot it means for real or \nI'm not lying for example we don't have any classes tomorrow no \ncap sorry to bother \nSorry to bother you \nyou hey I think I forgot one of my bags on the plane what are there any valuable items \ninside there are only cosmetics and Beach hats the only valuable thing is my parking \ncard oh what should I do now you should go to \nthe lost and found office perhaps there found your back where is it I don't know it would \nbe most helpful if you asked a steward \nit excuse me hello how can I help you \nsorry to bother you

shouldn't buy \ntoo many vegetables why we have no time to shop at the market on \nweekdays they will rot easily no no just because you don't know \nhow to store them do you have any tips most vegetables like carrots \npotatoes broccoli cabbage and celery should be stored in a plastic bag or container in the crisper of your \nfridge how about mushrooms mushrooms are best stored in a paper \nbag okay I will take some more mushrooms and oranges remember vegetables should be \nstored in a different part of the fridge than fruit this will prevent them from ripening too \n[Music] fast your
