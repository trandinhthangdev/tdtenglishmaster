guys \nnothing much \nhave you done the homework mr watson \ngave us \nit's due tomorrow so i haven't done \nanything \noh really what a relief \nbut i'm afraid i got bad news \nchris is sick so \nhe won't come to class today \nhe is sick \nwith what exactly \nnobody told us \ni hope he is still doing fine \nwell i only knew about this minutes ago \ni heard his mother talking with our \nteacher in the hall \nshe mentioned him \ncatching a cold last night or something \nis he okay \nhis mother sounds not so worried about \nhis condition so i assume he is fine \nif it's really just a common cold he \nwill be fine in a few days \nshould we call him to check up on him \ni guess he could use some encouragement \nbut it's only seven in the morning \ni think he is still asleep \nlet him have his rest \nsick people desperately need sleep to \nrecover \nwe can text him though \nhe can read it whenever he wakes up \ngood idea \nwhat should we tell him \njust simply explain how we know he is \nill and ask him for his condition first \nthen tell him we got him covered on \nschoolwork and other news \nalso tell him to take his medication \nseriously \nthere was one time that he was sick but \ndelayed taking medication \nso it continued for like two weeks \nhe got ill more severe than a comet cold \ni can't remember its name though \ni recalled \nanything else \nshould we visit him after school \nokay but let's buy him some fruits along \nthe way \nan apple a day keeps the doctor away \nand some oranges would help out a lot \ni agree then \ni'll tell him in advance \nwhat else can we do to help him \nmr watson homework \nknowing his nature i doubt he has given \nit a single thought \nwell then to help him is to help \nourselves too \n[Music] \nhey guys chris is replying to me \nwhat did he say \nhe thanked us for caring \nand he got the best person around to \nlook after him \ndoes he mean his mom \nyeah i also assume he was talking about \nhis mom too \nanyway \nchris told me that he is going well \nand he had enough fruits to last a week \nhe would appreciate a visit from us \nthough \nthen we will go straight to his house \nafter school \ni guess so \ntell him that and also mention that \ntomorrow is the due date for mr watson's \nhomework \nand i'll tell him that we will come over \nto finish that thing too \nit's for the best \nokay i'll tell him exactly that \nwell then \nwe will talk later \nokay \n[Music] \nthanks for watching \ndon't forget to like share \ncomment on my video please subscribe to \nlearn english with jessica channel to \nwatch more
