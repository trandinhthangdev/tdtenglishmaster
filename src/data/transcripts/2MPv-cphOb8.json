\nokay let me try the stuffed chicken \n[Music] \nbreast \n[Music] \nhow are you doing over here i was \nwondering \nif you could turn down the music loud \nmusic and restaurants \nis a pet peeve of mine sure \ni'll take care of that can i get you \nanother round of drinks \nno we are all settled for now \n[Music] \n15 minutes later are you still working \non your meals \ni'll need a doggie bag \nwould you mind wrapping this up too \ni'll bring you some containers and you \ncan box up your leftovers \ncan i interest you in dessert \ni'm stuffed could you please bring the \ncheck \ncomplaint at a store \nbetween a clerk and a client complaining \nabout a computer problem that was bought \nin a store \ngood morning how can i help you \nhi i'd like to make a complaint about a \ndefective laptop \ni bought here last month \ndo you have your store receipt with you \nyes i do here you go \nthere's a one-year store warranty on \nthis computer \nwe'll be able to take a look at it today \nat no charge to you if we can't find the \nproblem \nwe will exchange it for a new one \nthank you i'd appreciate that \nwhat seems to be the problem \ni think it's overheating it gets so hot \nwhenever i use it \nthat is strange for such a new computer \nperhaps there's something wrong with the \ncooling fan \ncould i take a look sure \nhere it is everything looks okay on the \noutside \ncould i ask a few questions \nyes of course how long do you use it \nbefore it overheats \nit usually feels very hot after one or \ntwo hours \nwhen it overheats do you notice any loss \nof function \ndoes windows run slower \ni have noticed that the touchpad becomes \nless sensitive to my touch \nactually what do you usually do \non the laptop i use it to check my \nemails \nand write articles for my blog \nthat shouldn't cause it to overheat \nthe internal fan should be able to \nhandle that \ncan you tell me what's wrong with it \nthen \nthere could be something wrong with one \nof the components perhaps the battery \nor the hard drive let me have a look \nokay \n[Music] \ni've just finished running hardware \ndiagnostics on the laptop \neverything looks fine the good news is \nthat the memory processor \nbios main board and battery are all \nworking properly \ndoesn't seem to be any damage or defects \nwith any of the hardware \nso what could the problem be \nthat depends is the area where you use \nthe laptop exposed to direct sunlight or \nheat \nnot at all i use it in the bedroom at \nnight \ndo you sit on the bed when using the \nlaptop \nyes it's usually on top of the covers on \nmy lap \nwhy that's probably why it's overheating \nthe covers prevent the ventilation \nsystem from working properly \nthe cloth blocks the bottom and side \nvents \nthat makes sense so \nif i don't use the laptop on my bed will \nit be okay \nit should be perfectly fine \njust remember wherever you use it to \nallow \nairflow freely through those vents \nthank you i will \n[Music] \nproduct complaint \ndialogue with a client on a product \ncomplaint good morning \ncan i help you i'd like to make a \ncomplaint \nabout a bluetooth speaker that i bought \nhere last week \ndo you have the receipt yes i do \nhere you go \nokay can you explain why this bluetooth \nspeaker doesn't work well \nit seems that this speaker doesn't have \ngood quality \nfor example the bluetooth connection is \nworse \nthan it claims and then the switch on \nbutton can't function \nproperly that's strange \nperhaps there's something wrong with the \nconnection could i take a look \nsure here it is \ncould i ask a few questions \nyes of course how were you using the \nspeaker when you tried to connect to the \nheadphone \nwhat kind of question is that \ni understand your upset miss i'm just \ntrying to understand the problem \ni'm afraid it's not our policy to \nreplace the speaker because of glitches \ni just connected it to the phone \naccording to instructions \ni have two phones and all of them can't \nconnect to the speaker \nusually the bluetooth can't connect \nbecause the bluetooth speaker connects \nto other devices \nfor this case you have two phones \nmaybe both of the bluetooth on your \nphones \nis on so that the speaker can't detect \nit \nto overcome this you can turn off the \nspeaker and turn it on \nagain before that you must make sure \nthere is \nonly one bluetooth on \nok but what about the switch on button \nthat doesn't work properly we are sorry \nthat you've had a problem with this \nspeaker \nwe'll check the switch on button with \nour technicians and get back to you \nimmediately okay that will work for me \nbut i think you also have to check the \nconnection too \nof course i will make sure about the \nconnection too \ncould you leave your contact and address \nwe will contact you soon \nsure here it is we'll do our best \nto get your speaker working as soon as \n[Music] \npossible \nhey rio how's your morning going so far \nhey deara it's fine until you came here \nso what's the problem this time \nbingo there is one customer who \ncomplains about this bluetooth speaker \nwhat's happened she claims this speaker \nhas a worse connection than it should be \nand then the switch on button doesn't \nwork properly \nokay i'll check it for a while \n[Music] \nit seems the wire in the speaker is \nbroken \nit will affect the switch on button so i \nwill repair the wire \nokay what about the connection \nmeanwhile for the connection you can \ntell the customer to check if there is \nanother bluetooth connection \nthat connects to the speaker if it still \ndoesn't give any effect \ntry to turn off and turn it on again \nafter a few minutes \ni tried to explain to the customer but \nshe told me to check it again \nand didn't listen to me \nso i don't know how to explain this when \ni see her again \nof course you are confused but seeing \nthis speaker reminds me of another way \nyou can take the brochure on the table \nbetween the two cabinets \noh what is this \nthis brochure contains pictures and \ninstructions on how to connect this \nbluetooth speaker to the headphone \ni make this for customers who are not \nfamiliar with current technology \nafter they see the picture in the \nbrochure they can practice it directly \nso they can immediately understand how \nto use it without many questions coming \nup \nwow that's a very good idea i will \nremember this \nthank you for the advice rio oh yeah \nmy pleasure \nfaulty TV \na faulty tv \ngood afternoon can i help you \ni hope so i bought
