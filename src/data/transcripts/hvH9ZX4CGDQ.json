into the \nHow to make fried dough \n[Music] \nkitchen the main ingredients are simple \nyou're going to need pork milk butter \nfried \ndough garlic onions eggs breadcrumbs \nsalt it's not complicated these \ningredients are all easy to find yes so \nat first put the ham in a food processor \nand blend it until smooth then you must \nadd the butter to a large Skillet and \nallow it to melt \ncompletely now stir in the onions and \ncook them until softened add the garlic \nStir It and cook for 15 seconds do we \nneed to do exact \ntiming just estimate now pour in the \nflour whisk and cook for 1 to 2 minutes \nthis helps you get rid of that raw flour \ntaste whisk in the milk and then add the \nham mix it continuously for a few \nminutes check for seasoning and add salt \nif needed then allow to cool completely \nI like to place it in the fridge for 45 \nminutes now this step requires my \nIngenuity not so much just form the ham \nmixture into short logs dip them in egg \nthen roll them in breadcrumbs to coat \nare there any other cooking \nsteps yes there are now heat your oil to \naround 350\u00b0 F deep fry for 2 to 3 \nminutes done we can serve them warm and
