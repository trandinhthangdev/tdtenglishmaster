colorful leaves \nit's such a beautiful scenery that no \nwords can describe you've got to see it \nfor yourself \nwow that sounds wonderful i've thought \nof plenty of things we can do \nwe can have

carving \ndialogue 4 chestnut roasting and pumpkin \ncarving \n[Music] \nhi meg \nhey joe come on in what are you carrying \nthose bags look heavy let me help you \ncarry them inside \nthanks these are chestnuts \nchestnuts wow i can't believe they are \nselling chestnuts already autumn is \nreally here \ni know right halloween is this weekend \nand it's gonna be thanksgiving soon \nanyway i saw some raw chestnuts when \ngoing grocery shopping at the local \nfarmers market yesterday \nthey looked so good that i couldn't help \nit \ni bought some so that we will have \nsomething to eat while carving pumpkins \ntoday \ngreat idea \nroasted chestnuts are one of my favorite \nstreet food in the cold season \nbut i always have been buying roasted \nchestnuts from street vendors \ni actually have never tried roasting \nthem at home before \ndon't worry roasting chestnuts at home \nare not hard at all i'll show you how to \ndo that \ncool let's get to the kitchen \n[Music] \nso what do we do \nfirst we need to go through all the raw \nchestnuts we bought and pick out the \nbest ones \nhow do we know which ones are not good \nlook at their shells the good ones will \nhave hard and shiny shells \nthey shouldn't be too light and rattle \nwhen you shake them \nah okay let me see most of the chestnuts \nseem fine and not spoiled \nyeah i like to shop at the farmer's \nmarket because most of the food there is \nfresh \nright i agree \noh i just found three chestnuts that are \ncracked it's best if we throw them away \nokay what's next \nwe need to wash them properly and dry \nthem off because we'll touch the shells \nwhen \neating alright done \nnext we'll make an x-shaped cut on the \nshelf this step is really important \nbecause it will prevent the chestnuts \nfrom exploding when being roasted \nah that's why \nthen we'll put them in the oven right \nyeah it'll take 10 to 20 minutes we'll \nwait till shells burst open and the \nchestnuts look golden brown \ni see thanks for teaching me how to make \nroasted chestnuts i could do it at home \nnow \nno problem \nwell we wait for the chestnuts let's \nswitch to carving the pumpkins \nhere are the pumpkins we picked out on \nthursday let me find two sharp knives \nokay let's start by cutting out the top \npart \ndo you need a spoon i often remove some \nof the flesh so it's easier to carve \ngood idea can i also borrow a marker and \nwant to draw the face before i start \ncarving \nhere you are be careful when carving \nhey will thanks \n[Music] \nyou're done already so fast \nyep i'm done how does it look \nit looks amazing you are really an \nexpert \nthanks i'm used to carving pumpkins \nsince i do this every year \nhey i think our chestnuts are done \nroasting they smell so good \nyay let's get them out and eat them \nwhile they're still hot \n[Music] \nthanks for watching \ndon't forget to like share \ncomment on my video \nplease subscribe to learn english with \njessica channel to watch more
