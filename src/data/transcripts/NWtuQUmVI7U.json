different \ndesigns online \nhere are some styles i feel interested \nin \nokay show me what you've got \nso this is a modern style with kind of \nwhite plain walls a darker color tone \nfor furniture \nand a lot of glasses and marble flooring \n[Music] \nto be honest it looks great i love \nsimplicity however we plan to have a \nbaby in the near future \nso do you think we should try something \na little bit softer \nyou were right \nhow about this traditional style with a \nneutral color tone with floral patterns \nlooks a bit old-fashioned to me \nyou like this style don't you \num \nnot really i just like the cozy feeling \nso do i i prefer something that makes me \nfeel at home \nany other options that are both modern \nand cozy \nyes this one \nwhat do you think it still looks simple \nand modern but a lot cozier with a \nwarmer color \nlight gray or brownie is trending this \nyear \ni like this one especially the wooden \nflooring \nwe can use it for bedrooms very \naffordable i want to have carpet in the \nliving room \nall right how about the kitchen \ni want material that is easy to clean \nand waterproof \nright how about the color \ni'm into brown or beige colors like this \none \nme too in short our taste is modern but \ncozy \nneutral brown beige tone \nthen i think wooden furniture will be an \nexcellent match \nsure i will note it down \nwe will discuss a detailed design \ntomorrow okay \nyes i will do more research \n[Music] \nSituation 2 Decorating the room for a baby girl. \nsituation 2 \ndecorating the room for a baby girl \n[Music] \nhi

really how is it going \nit must be the cutest room in the house \nwe have just started recently \nhow is your plan for the baby girls room \nwe always like minimalism you know so \nthe room style will match with other \nrooms also \nthree walls are light brown and one wall \nis white the floor will be covered with \nbeige carpet and a white fur rug \nnice that's very modern and cute at the \nsame time what are there in the room i \ncan see the crib over there \ni try to only put necessary kinds of \nstuff \nthere will be a crib a medium-sized \nwardrobe for clothes and a small cabinet \nfor things like diapers or little things \nfor the baby all in white \nwait you mentioned one white wall before \nthat right why only one \ngood question \ni intended to put a huge wooden shelf \nthat has the size of the whole wall \nwhat is it for \nfor children's books and toys and for \ndecorating purposes also \ni think books and toys are very colorful \nso they will be stand out on the white \nwall \nvery unique idea \nmy friends usually spend the wall on \ncute stickers \ni also decorate other walls with cute \npictures of animals but also in a \nminimalism style \nah i forgot to mention a chair that's \nall \nhave you bought all those furniture \nyes i have \nnot many though the only thing that \ntakes time is painting in the big shelf \nsounds like a very lovely room
