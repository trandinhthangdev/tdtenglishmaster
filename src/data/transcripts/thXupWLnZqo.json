    "transcript": "Intro \n[Music] \noh I'll never be able to understand fast \nspeech I feel helpless when listening to \nEnglish it's so fast that I can't get a \nword I can't catch up are these phrases \nand sentences familiar to you have you \never said that \nbefore in this video we'll help you sort \nthis out and you'll know what to do when \ndealing with fast \nspeech \nWhat makes fast speech so difficult \n[Music] \nso what makes fast speech so difficult \nto understand \nMia well first of all it's because of \nthe unfamiliar pronunciation and fast \nspeech fast speech can lead to certain \nsounds and syllables being pronounced \ndifferently oh sometimes people even \ndropped all together making it hard for \nbeginners \nyeah here are some examples what are you \ndoing what you doing do you do you can \nyou can \nyou oh because of this some English \nLearners get very \nconfused they thought this is supposed \nto be said like this but it is \nnot this happens with people who are \nused to slow speech they are not exposed \nto conversation with different speaking \nspeeds true they feel like they're \nlistening to totally different words or \nphrases another reason is that your \npronunciation might be \nincorrect which makes it difficult for \nyou to catch words in fast \nconversations can you clarify that well \nyou might actually know the words but \nstruggle to recognize them in the \nspeech right whenever I can't understand \nthe word it can lead to panic and and \nloss of focus making it hard to follow \nthe rest of the \nconversation the final reason I'd like \nto discuss is vocabulary slang and \nidioms I believe this poses the greatest \nchallenge for English Learners \nespecially in terms of \nlistening regardless of how fast someone \nspeaks you can usually recognize the \nsounds of words you're already familiar \nwith is that \nso yes for instance consider the word \nhello this is often one of the first \nwords you learn and you can typically \ncatch it no matter how quickly it's \nspoken I see as you become accustomed to \na word its fast pronunciation becomes \nless daunting so if you master the \nvocabulary speed will no longer be the \nbig problem that's right once you've \nunderstood most of the vocabulary in a \nsentence you can comprehend about 70% of \nthe sentence itself particularly With \nIdioms understanding the context is \ncrucial but in general vocabulary is the \nkey \nright sure however acquiring vocabulary \nisn't an overnight success it takes time \nbut no worries we're all in the same \nTips to speak English fast \nboat so how are we going to do that what \nis the solution for fast \nspeech well first of all relax and \nlisten what if I don't get the meaning \nof the whole \nsentence it's no big deal believe me \nwhen you hang loose you'll be surprised \nby how much information your brain can \nprocess okay so I shouldn't force myself \non understanding the whole \nthing yes some try to understand every \nsingle word which is what holds them \nback the brain focuses too much on what \nyou don't understand \nand I get it now that makes people \naccidentally Overlook or forget the \nbigger vision and as a result they're in \nthe middle of \nnowhere so take it easy and keep \nlistening you'll pick up on sounds and \neverything will start to make \nsense next thing you should bear in mind \nis vocabulary try to enrich your \nvocabulary get yourself used to words \nand phrases the more the \nbetter I agree the more we learn the \nmore things make sense speed will not \nmatter \nanymore because when you already know \nthe words you can recognize it sound \neasier yes the sound can change a bit in \nfast speech but it's not impossible to \nhear it out you'll get the general idea \nof the whole speech when you grasp most \nof the \nwords and how can you expand your \nvocabulary \nMia way too many reading flash card \nnotes even games there's something you \nshould know too many topics or ideas \nsometimes doesn't help on finding \nmaterials resources to learn you'll see \ntons of them and they will be \noverwhelming quality saves you energy so \nChoose Wisely and my tip for you is to \nchoose what you like or what interests \nyou if you're a football fan go for a \nSports magazine or watch a football \nmatch in English \nor if fashion is something you're into \nlisten to audios or videos with that \ntopic and finally all you need is \npatience practice makes \nperfect and stop feeding yourself things \nlike I can't or I can \nnever absolutely have faith in ourselves \ntime will tell the most important thing \nis you will never give up and keep \ntrying consistency is key set a Target \nfor every \nday it can be a routine of listening for \n15 minutes every \nmorning or 15 minutes listening before \nbedtime just take a small step make it a \nhabit of \nyours I know it can be really difficult \nat first the beginning is always the \nhardest I know but once you've got on \nthe right track everything starts to be \nmuch \neasier do not let procrastination get in \nthe way if you can do this I believe \nthat you will be able to greatly improve \nyour listening skills fast speech will \nno longer scare you so now what are you \nwaiting for pull yourself together and \nbegin your journey that's the end of the \nvideo thank you for
