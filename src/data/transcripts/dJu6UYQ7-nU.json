hurry up friends we will not \nwant to miss a moment at the club \nexactly I can't wait let's go \n[Music] \nhi everyone welcome to the second \nmeeting of the month I'm Leila the \npresident of the

\ntopic we are going to discuss \ntoday the topic is elevate your English \nspeaking \nskills and to show us how to do it I \ninvited a very special guest to our \nmeeting \ntoday now let's give the floor to Chris \nMilton the winner of English \nChampionship contest two years in a row \ngood afternoon Chris Welcome to our club \nhi Leila friends thank you for having me \nhere today today I want to talk about \nsomething that many language Learners \nface please feel free to tell me what \nyour difficulty is when it comes to \nspeaking English uhoh yes please I think \nthe most difficult part is \nvocabulary okay you are right words are \na very small unit but they play a big \nrole in learning \nlanguage without words we can't piece \nthings together we can't for form a \nproper sentence or \nconversation any other difficulties in \nspeaking \nEnglish my problem is um how to say I \nthink I have a good vocabulary but not \nbeing able to use it \neffectively I totally got you friend we \noften work hard to learn new words and \nphrases but do we actually use them do \nwe apply them into our everyday \nconversations or do we mostly stick to \nfamiliar and simple words \nthat's true \nChris I often find myself struggling to \nuse the new vocabulary I \nlearn it's frustrating because I know \nthe words but I can't seem to use them \nnaturally I completely understand there \nare a few reasons why this happens \nfirstly many of us learn languages \npassively just through reading or \nlistening but for Effective language \nlearning we need to engage our ears \nmouths and \neyes we should learn through listening \nspeaking and observing images before \ndiving into writing that makes \nsense so what can we do to improve our \nability to use new \nwords well one important thing is to \nlearn vocabulary in context instead of \nlearning individual words try to learn \nthem in phrases or \nsentences this way you understand how \nthey are used in real life \nsituations that's a great tip I'll \ndefinitely try to put more phrases into \nmy vocabulary \npractice another helpful practice is to \nfocus on specific topics when learning \nvocabulary by studying words related to \na particular subject you'll be better \nprepared to use them in conversations on \nthat \ntopic wow I have never thought about \nthat so instead of learning random words \nI should just choose a topic and learn \nwords related to it exactly it can be \nanything you're interested in like \nsports travel or even \ncooking this way you build a library of \nrelevant words and phrases that you can \nuse when discussing those topics I'll \nstart doing that it sounds like a more \norganized approach to learning \nvocabulary great additionally reading \nnewspapers and watching English videos \nis a great tool too by doing those \nactivities you expose yourself to \ndifferent \nvocabulary Chris is right but I want to \nadd another benefit of this method \nreading newspapers and watching English \nvideos will help you understand how \nwords are used in \ncontext so \ntrue wow I'll make it a habit to read \nEnglish articles and watch videos \nregularly \nwonderful lastly one effective method I \nalways suggest is to use a new word as \nsoon as you learn it whenever you come \nacross a word find its meaning and use \nit in a sentence of your \nown make sure to use that word at least \nonce during the day that's a practical \napproach I'll try to actively use new \nwords rather than just memorizing them \nthat's wonderful remember it's okay to \nmake mistakes try to speak English as \nmuch as you can even if you make \nmistakes and always take a moment to \nthink before you speak so you can Master \nthe new vocabulary you've learned thank \nyou so much Chris these tips are really \nhelpful \nI feel more motivated to improve my \nEnglish speaking skills \nnow you're welcome I'm glad I could help \nremember practicing every day even for a \nfew minutes can make a big difference \nkeep at it and you'll see progress in no \ntime that's very inspiring \nChris in my case I often practice \nspeaking English to myself about my \ndaily activities my thoughts and \nideas true Lea or you can come to the \nEnglish Club practicing your speaking \nwith all of us here you know studying in \na group can bring up so many benefits \ntoo absolutely David Noah and I often \nhave conversations in English we help \neach other spotting mistakes and give \neach other \nSolutions that's a Dream Team you \nhave lastly everyone please remember \npractice makes \nperfect we will definitely keep that in \nmind thank you \nthank you so much Chris thank you again \nfor your \nguidance no problem at all we're all \nhere to \n[Music] \nsupport don't forget to like share and
