    "transcript": "[Music] \ntalk \nabout your favorite season \nrob chris natasha and \nrose are talking about their favorite \nseason \nand the conversation slowly turned into \na discussion \nwatch the video to see at the end which \nseason do they all like most \nguys i'm wondering which \nseason is the best season of the year \nin my opinion i like winter the most \nseriously you're from a tropical country \nnatasha \ni thought you can't bear the low \ntemperature in winter here \nwell to be fair the reason why \ni love winter here is that i'm from a \ntropical country \nin the past i had never seen snow \nnever got to wear many layers of clothes \nand definitely never celebrated \nchristmas \nwait your family never celebrated \nchristmas before \nbut you guys do now yes \nit's hard not to with such a joyful and \nfestive \natmosphere it has become one of the \nholidays that i look forward to the most \ni have a different point of view i \nprefer \nautumn i love the cool breezy weather \nit gives me a really peaceful vibe \nwe all know you get too excited when the \nseason comes \noh really \njust the thought of sitting beside the \nwindow with a cup of tea \nand watching the leaves falling down \nalready warms my heart \nso much i think autumn is quite great \ntoo \nnot as amazing as winter of course but i \nlove \ndrinking pumpkin latte and halloween is \nalways \nso fun here \nyou're absolutely right pumpkin lattes \nat starbucks \nare the best but \nautumn is like a signal that the school \nyear is going to start soon \nso i don't like it i prefer summer \ni have tons of free time to go wherever \ni want to \nactually we all kind of enjoy summer \nwhether we like it or not \nright trips summer fruit the sun shines \nevery day \neven sudden summer rains are beautiful i \njust \nlove everything about it but the days \nwhen it's too \nhot ugh i can't handle that \ni sweat easily so summer sometimes \nannoys me \nwell every season has their own \ndrawbacks \nbut to me the hot weather it's not such \na big deal \ni still love it when summer comes \nseems like we all have different \nopinions about this \nunlike you guys i'm a spring person \nwow really i've always thought that you \nwere a winter like me \nno winter is too cold for me \ni hate it when i can't go out just \nbecause it's too cold or snowy \nwhen spring comes the weather gets \nwarmer \nand it's also the time when lots of \nflowers bloom \neverything in spring is just pretty and \nlively \nto me spring is kind of a boring season \ni don't really see something specific or \nunique about it \ni don't think so spring is the first \nseason of the year \nwhich means it's a new beginning it \nmotivates me to neglect \nall the bad things that happened in the \nprevious year move on and try to be \nbetter \nthat sounds really inspiring \nyes my brother told me that once \noh speaking about siblings my brother is \ncoming back to america tonight \nreally i'm so happy for you he's been \ngone for so long \nthank you we're going to pick him up at \nthe airport so i think i should go home \nit's also a bit late now yeah \nlet's all go home we will continue this \ndiscussion tomorrow \ngoodbye \n[Music] \nhigher as equity guys scurried through \nthe sidelines after several \ntechnologies hello grandma \ngood evening rose we have just gone out \nwith your friends \nyes grandma did you have \nfun of course i did \nwe went to a cafe shop and we just \ntalked and enjoyed our drinks \nsounds nice what did you talk about \nwell we were just discussing our \nfavorite season of the year \nbut it was more like deciding on which \nseason \nis the absolute best season \noh how cute do you have a favorite \nseason grandma \nme no \nyou see when you've reached my age the \nseason is just another name for a time \nlife goes on and you live without \nnoticing which \nseason it currently is i have more \nimportant things that i need to think \nabout \nthat's deep i mean the season is just \nanother name for \ntime part yes \nso i don't really have a favorite season \ni also don't think that there's \nsomething about a particular \nseason that makes me like it more than \nthe others \nat least at the moment but you must have \nhad one when you were young \nright i think i \ndid i was always excited for summer to \ncome \nwow really my friend chris likes summer \ntoo \nso what makes him like this season \nwell he said that summer gives him \nplenty of time to go hang out with \nfriends \nto travel he loves the summer heat and \nthe light from the sun \ntoo what about you grandma \nwhat i love about summer is that it's \nunpredictable \ntoday might be a breezy and bright day \nbut tomorrow it might be \nrainy and cloudy it shows how magical \nnature can be \nand i used to be in awe of that \nbut isn't it that unpredictability \nannoying sometimes \ni mean what if you're playing with your \nfriends and it suddenly rains \ni was 10 at the time rose i loved \nshowering in the rain \nas a kid getting wet because of the rain \nor because of the sweats wasn't that big \nof a \ndeal after \nall you didn't have anyone to stay \nimpressed for \nyou may be right the reason why you like \na season can speak a lot about your \npersonality too \nyou know people know how unpredictable \nthe weather and summer is \nbut you rarely find someone that likes \nsummer because of that \nbut it's my reason and your grandpa used \nto say that that means i tend to \nappreciate \nthings that people don't really care \nmuch about \noh now when i think about it it's so \n[Music] \ntrue \n[Music] \ngood morning guys hello \nlet's sit down the weather is really \nnice today \nsee summer can have cool days too \noh you remind me about our conversation \nyesterday chris \nshould we continue yes \nwe still haven't decided which season is \nthe best one \nyesterday i told my grandma what we \ntalked about and she said something \nreally interesting \nwhat is it she said that the reason why \nyou like a season \ncan speak a lot about your personality \nwow i haven't really thought of that \nbefore \nbut it seems true i love summer because \ni can travel everywhere \nand i'm a very active person i can't \nstay in one place for too long \nthat's right i thought about it too \nand i like autumn because it gives me a \npeaceful vibe \ni'm an introvert i prefer quietness and \ni love \nbeing on my own it's really a perfect \nmatch \nrob loves spring because it's a new \nbeginning so i guess that means he's \nsomeone who always moves forward \nand very excited for the future \noh my god that's so true \nwhat about me you like winter because \nyou can layer clothes \nwatching the snowfall and celebrate \nchristmas with your family right \nthat's true well then i think you're \njust a person who really enjoys \nlife you like sceneries you care about \nthe way you dress \nand you love being with your family a \ngirl with a very put together lifestyle \nin my opinion \nyeah that seems like me even though i've \nnever \nthought that highly of myself but my \nfriends and relatives sometimes said the \nsame \nthing you did you know what \ni think the best season doesn't exist \nafter all \ni mean it's difficult to find a similar \nadvantage between all seasons \nand even if we can find it i don't think \nevery single person will agree \ni think the same people have different \nopinions and that's completely fine \nwhat's really important is that we live \nlife to the fullest \nand try to find the good in every phase \nof the year \neven in a time we don't really like \nwow that's a very mature thought i can't \nagree more \nme too \nthanks for watching don't forget to like \nshare comment
