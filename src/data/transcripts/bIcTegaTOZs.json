\nhey Mia everything looks perfect but I think it's going to rain \nlater did you check the weather forecast oh I did this morning and it \nwas clear but you're right those clouds do look ominous \nI always trust my instincts when it comes to weather my grandma used to say that if \nthe birds fly low expect rain and a show that's a neat saying well if it \ndoes start to rain we can always move to that gazebo over there good idea for now let's enjoy the \nsandwiches and the fresh air by the way what's in this sandwich \nsmells amazing it's a surprise but I'll give you a hint it's a Mediterranean \nclassic H I'm intrigued well let's eat up before those clouds decide to shower \n[Music] us throw in the \ntowel Lily you look pretty frustrated during that last set everything \nokay yeah it's just this routine feels so tough I was \nalmost ready to throw in the towel today throw in the towel what do you \nmean oh it's an idiom it means I was thinking of giving up because it was too \nhard gotcha you know everyone has those \ndays or from what I've seen you're making good progress thanks \nNoah it just feels like I hit a wall sometimes and I can't move past it \nthat's natural remember why you started this journey it's okay to feel down but don't \nlet that be the reason to quit you're right I appreciate the pep talk I'll keep pushing \nforward that's the spirit if you ever need a workout buddy or some motivation you know where to \nfind me thanks Noah let's crush it together next \n[Music] time \nTom didn't tell us how big your house \nwas wow Alex this place is massive Tom didn't tell us how big your \nhouse was thanks Olivia it's been in the family for years \nwe're quite attached to it it's like something out of a magazine architecture the art everything \nis so detailed I did mention it was impressive but I guess I didn't emphasize the size I've always loved \nthis place appreciate the kind words it can be a bit much to maintain but we've \nmade so many memories here I can imagine with a house this big you could host \nsome epic parties we've had our fair share speaking of which how about a mini \ntour before dinner I'd love that especially if there are any secret rooms or \npassages ah always The Adventurous one Ethan I'm in two Let's Get The Grand \nTour Alex all right follow me let the adventures \nbegin we already know the \ntruth Jake we need to talk about what happened at the party last \nweekend oh uh what about it look look Jake we already know the truth there's \nno point in trying to hide it anymore I I didn't know how to tell you \nboth I didn't want to upset anyone it's always better to be upfront about things Secrets only make matters \nworse we're your friends Jake we would have understood I'm really sorry I didn't \nthink breaking that vase was a big deal but I should have owned up to it it was a gift from my grandma it had stim \nmental value the important thing now is to find a way to make \namends Jake I believe you didn't mean any harm I promise I'll try to find a \nsimilar vase or somehow compensate for Emma it's not about the vas CH it's \nabout trust just promise us no more secrets promise and I'm truly \n[Music] sorry she raised her hand to ask a \nquestion Bella did you notice the new girl Zoe during the lecture yeah she raised her hand to ask \na question right she seemed really smart exactly her question was really \ninsightful I had never thought about the topic in that way before me neither it's always refreshing \nto have New Perspectives in class do you know where she's from I think she mentioned during the \nintroduction that she's from Australia Ah that's cool International \nstudents often bring such unique viewpoints we should probably introduce ourselves after \nclass I was thinking the same it's always good to make new friends \nespecially if they're as interesting as Zoe seems to be \ndefinitely plus forming study groups with diverse members always help helps in understanding the subject \nbetter agreed let's approach her together after the lecture I'm sure she'd appreciate some \nfriendly faces sounds like a plan Aiden let's do \nit have you ever seen a [Music] \ntsunami this documentary is so intense have you ever seen a tsunami \nMaya no and I hope I never do it's one of those forces of nature that truly \nterrifies me how about you no what I've \nread a lot about them the sheer power and destruction they can bring is \nmindboggling yeah and it's so tragic how they often strike with little to no warning so many lives lost in an \ninstant that's why there's a push for more advanced early Warning Systems especially in areas prone to \ntsunamis true technology can be a real Lifesaver in these \nsituations but still it's always good to know the signs and be prepared just in \ncase absolutely like the receding of the tide if you see the water pull away from \nthe shore Suddenly It's a warning sign right I've also heard that \nsometimes there's a loud roaring sound almost like a train it's chilling \nto think about it is Nature's power is all inspiring and \nhumbling but on a lighter note I'm grateful we're here just enjoying a peaceful day me too Leo always good to \nbe reminded of the beauty and calm of nature as [Music] \nwell did you sleep well last night \n[Music] hey Casey good morning did you sleep \nwell last night morning Alex actually not really I stayed up late watching a movie \nand now I regret it how about you oh I can relate but for me it was \nbecause my neighbors were having a loud party until 2: a.m. I hardly got any sleep \noh no that's frustrating have you ever talked to them about the noise I have a couple of times they're \nusually considerate but last night was an exception anyway how was the \nmovie it was great I watched the midnight sky ever heard of it oh yeah \nthat's the one with George Clooney right I've been meeting to watch it yep that's the one it's a bit slow paced but the \nstory is really touching I definitely recommend it if you're into drama and \nsci-fi I'll keep that in mind hopefully on a night when I don't have an early meeting the next \nday speaking of which I should head out soon got it we should grab coffee again \nsoon maybe next time on a day when we've both had better sleep \ndefinitely take care Casey you too Alex and try to get rest \n[Music] \ntonight my favorite color is [Music] \nblue look at that kite Ethan my favorite color is blue just like that one up \nthere oh I can see why it's such a calming and beautiful shade of blue \nalmost like the sky exactly blue is always been special \nto me it reminds me of the ocean and clear skies what's your favorite \ncolor I've always been fond of green it's the color of nature growth \nand Harmony plus it reminds me of our hiking trips that makes \nsense when you think about it blue and green together create such a Serene image the sky meeting the \ntrees absolutely they complement each other perfectly just like \nus H that's a sweet way to put it speaking of colors should we get some \npaint for our art project next week great idea I think a blend of our \nfavorite colors would make our project Stand Out agreed let's head to the art \nstore after this and pick out the best shades of blue and green sounds like a plan \nMia how was your \n[Music] weekend Hey Taylor long time no see how \nwas your weekend hi Jamie oh it was quite \nadventurous I went hiking up in the mountains and you that sounds exciting my weekend was \nmore laidback I just visited my grandparents in the countryside \nthat's lovely there's always something comforting about visiting family how are they \ndoing they're good thanks for asking they always have a ton of stories \nto share it's like a trip down memory lane every time I visit I can \nimagine by the way have you tried the new Cafe downtown I went there after my hike and \nthe pastries were to die for no but I've heard about it \nI'm a sucker for good pastries maybe we could check it out together next \nweekend sounds like a plan I'd love to let's make it a date \nperfect I'll text you the details later this week great looking forward to it \nhave a good run J thanks Taylor you [Music] \ntoo bite the bullet [Music] \nhey Riley you seem a bit stressed what's up oh hey Sam it's just these upcoming \nexams I'm not feeling prepared at all I get that but sometimes you just \nhave to bite the bullet and give it your best shot bite the bullet what does that \nmean it's an idiom it means to face a difficult situation with courage even if \nyou you don't want to oh I see I guess you're right I've \nbeen putting off studying because I'm scared of how much I don't know it's natural to feel that way but \nremember more you avoid it the harder it gets better to tackle it head on \nnow thanks Sam I needed that I'll start with the subjects I find hardest \nfirst that's the spirit if you need any help or want to study together just let me know I \nappreciate that let's get through this [Music] \ntogether what's the weather like [Music] \noutside hey Sam you just came in what's the weather like outside it's surprisingly chilly for \nthis time of the year and there's a light drizzle I think Autumn is coming \nearly oh I love the Autumn season the colors the crisp air \nEverything feels so refreshing true but I wasn't prepared for it \ntoday left my umbrella and jacket at home classic me oh Sam always forgetful but don't \nworry we'll stay here until the rain stops this Cafe is so cozy \nanyway that sounds perfect I've always loved the warm of this place especially when it's cold \noutside and their hot chocolate is to die for speaking of which should we order \nsome it's the perfect weather for it absolutely let's indulge here's two unexpected weather \nand delightful company cheers to [Music] \nthat I'm feeling a bit tired today \nJake I'm feeling a bit tired today I think the new project is taking \na toll on me I get that it's been a hectic week for all of us have you been getting \nenough sleep not really I've been staying up late to catch up on \nwork plus my neighbor's dog has been so noisy lately oh that's tough maybe you could \nuse some earplugs they've been a lifesaver for me during noisy \nnights that's a good idea I might give them a try and maybe I should also start \nsetting a strict bedtime definitely sleep is crucial especially with the kind of workload we \nhave and don't hesitate to ask for help if you need it we're a team after \nall thanks Jake that means a lot I'll keep that in mind how about you how have you been \nmanaging I've Had My Moments but regular breaks and short walks have been \nhelpful plus meditation before sleep does wonders I've heard about that maybe I \nshould give meditation a try anything for a good night's sleep absolutely remember it's all about \nfinding what works for you and sticking to \nit burn the Midnight Oil \nAlex have you been burning the midnight oil lately I've seen you here late every \nnight this week H yes these exams have me working around the \nclock I just want to be well prepared how about you I've had a few late nights \nmyself but I'm trying to balance my study schedule so I don't exhaust myself that's smart I've been feeling \nthe strain especially this morning my eyes were so \nheavy it's important to give yourself breaks Alex burning the midnight oil is \nfine occasionally but consistent sleep deprivation isn't good for you you're right I need to find a better \nRhythm maybe take short naps or switch to a more reasonable study schedule definitely and remember quality \nover quantity it's about how efficiently you study not just the number of \nhours true thanks Nora I needed to hear that how about we take a break now grab \nsome coffee sounds perfect let's recharge and get back to it with fresh \nMinds agreed a balanced approach is the way to \ngo my cat knocked over the vase \nyesterday d Daniel my cat knocked over the vase yesterday I can't believe the Mischief \nshe gets into oh no was it an expensive vase thankfully not but it was a gift \nfrom my grandmother more sentimental value you know that's unfortunate cats can be so \ncurious sometimes they love exploring every nook and cranny tell me about it \nI'm thinking of buying some toys to distract her from such Adventures any \nrecommendations for sure how about a cat tower or a scratching post they love climbing and \nit might keep her away from the delicate items that sounds like a good idea maybe \nI'll also get some interactive toys keep her occupied you know absolutely toys that stimulate \ntheir hunting instincts work great like laser pointers or feather \nones perfect thanks Daniel I'll pick some up hopefully my other vases will now be \nsafe fingers crossed and if all else fails maybe a slight rearrangement at \nhome keep the breakables out of her [Music] \nreach we're out of milk can you pick some [Music] \nup Sam we're out of milk can you pick Sam up on your way back from the \ngym sure no problem do we need anything else bread eggs maybe some \nfruit oh good thinking yes grab some bananas and oranges too if you can we're running low \non those got it bananas oranges and milk \nanything else maybe some cereal the kids love the Honey Nut \none all right I'll pick that set up too by the way there's a new store that \nopened nearby they have fresh organic produce want me to check it out oh yes I \nheard about it see if they have any fresh berries the kids love them in their \nyogurt berries noted I'll take a look and let you know what I find thanks Sam \noh and don't forget the milk it's the main thing don't worry it's at the top \nof my list [Music] \nthe ball is in your \ncourt Jack I've done my part of the presentation and shared all the data with you now the ball is in your \ncourt thanks Mia I appreciate all the hard work you've put into this I'll \nfinalize the proposal and present it to the board next week perfect do you need any additional \ninput from my side or perhaps a run through before the final \npresentation a run through sounds great let's schedule one for Friday we can iron out any kinks then \nagreed I want to make sure we're both on the same page this project is crucial \nfor our team absolutely we've got one shot to impress the board and thanks for giving \nme the lead on this I'll make sure to bring it home I trust you Jack and remember Teamwork Makes the Dream \nWork couldn't agree more I'll draft the final slides and get back to you by \nthirstday latest perfect I'll await your update thanks Mia with our combined \nefforts I'm sure we'll Ace \nthis he's in debt to the bank because he bought that big \nhouse Ryan did you hear about Jake he's in debt to the bank because he bought that \nbig house on Elm Street seriously that house is \nhuge I wonder why he made such a move he was always talking about living \nwithin his means I know right but he mentioned that it was a good investment \nopportunity and the property rates are bound to go up in a few years that may be true but proper \nInvestments can be risky especially if it's causing Financial strain right now \nexactly Sarah told me he's taken on two jobs just to keep up with the mortgage payments it sounds so \nstressful wow that's tough I hope he's able to manage but sometimes we get carried away \nby dreams without assessing the reality of the situation so true and it's not just \nabout the money owning such a big house house comes with its own set of responsibilities and \nmaintenance absolutely well I hope things turn around for him soon we \nshould check in on him maybe offer some help or support agreed we'll invite him over for \ndinner next week it's the least we can do sounds like a plan we're all friends \nafter all and we need to have each other's [Music] \nbacks what you said was quite true \nRaj remember last month when you told me to focus on self-care not to stretch myself too thin with \nwork yeah I do I was just worried about you seeing you so stressed and \noverworked well I took a week off spent time raing and took some long walks in nature \nand honestly what you said was quite true I I feel so much better now and I'm \nmore productive than before that's great to hear Lara sometimes we need to take a step \nback and recharge to move forward effectively I used to think that constant hustle was the only way but now \nI've realized the importance of balance in life it's a lesson we all learn at \nsome point and I'm glad you found your balance you deserve all the peace and \nhappiness in the world thanks Raj your advice was like a wakeup \ncall I'm thinking of taking short breaks more often maybe even try \nmeditation meditation is a game changer I've been doing it for a year now and it \nreally helps with Clarity and focus I can show you some beginner techniques if you'd like that sounds \nwonderful I'd love to learn from you it's funny how sometimes a simple \nconversation can lead to such positive changes \nabsolutely conversations connections and genuine care for each other make the \nworld a better [Music] \nplace do you guys have any big plans [Music] \ntonight hey Ben Claire do you guys have any big plans tonight not really I was thinking of \nordering some pizza and binge watching a new series need some downtime after this \nhectic week that sounds so relaxing Ben I on the other hand have planned a \ndinner out with some college friends it's been ages since we all met \nup oh that sounds fun Claire I'm actually torn between going to a live concert downtown or just \ntaking it easy at home which band is playing tonight it's the sound wave Le I've \nheard they're really good live but then my couch is also quite \ntempting why not do both go to the concert tonight and then have a lazy Sunday at home \ntomorrow that's a balanced plan Claire Amy I'd say go for it the sound waves \nhave a great reputation for their life performances you guys might be right \nokay I'll book the tickets thanks for the push anytime and Ben enjoy your pizza and \nseries [Music] \nnight have you seen my glasses \nanywhere oh I can't find my glasses Jordan have you seen my glasses \nanywhere oh didn't you leave them on the coffee table last night I thought I did \nbut they're not there now H did you check the kitchen sometimes you leave them there \nwhen you're having coffee in the morning no look and without them everything's a blur it's so \nfrustrating don't worry we'll find them think back where's the last place you \nremember having them I remember reading a book in the studio room but I already looked \nthere let's retre your steps after reading did you go to the balcony yes I went there to water the \nplants let me check there [Music] \naha found them they were stuck between the sofa cushions and the living \nroom oh relief thanks Jordan I need to be more mindful of \nwhere I put things happens to the best of us maybe consider getting one of those glasses \nchains to keep them around your \nneck I think I left my keys in the kitchen [Music] \nChris I can't find my keys anywhere I think I left them in the kitchen did you check on the counter \nthat's where you usually drop them I just glance there but let me have a closer look while you're at it maybe \ncheck in the fridge too you have a habit of absentmindedly placing things \ninside oh come on I did that once twice actually last week it was \nyour phone all right all right checking and \nnope not in the fridge or on the counter what about the draw next to the \noven you sometimes keep them there when you're cooking found them they were in the \ndrawer I really need a dedicated spot for these Keys how about a key hook \nright by the door that way you can hang them up as soon as you come in \nthat's a brilliant idea Chris thanks for always having my back always now let's head out before \nwe're \nlate don't cry over spilled [Music] \nmilk oh no I'm so sorry Max I can't believe I did \nthat hey it's okay accidents happen luckily my laptop wasn't there \nbut your papers and your notes I feel terrible look don't cry over spilled \nmilk it's just some notes I can rewrite them are you sure I can help you with \nthem it's fine really thanks for offering though I'll be more careful \nnext time I just need to pay attention to my surroundings we all have our clumsy \nmoments just just remember to breathe and slow down a bit thank you Max for understanding I \npromise to make it up to you no need to let's just clean this up and move on and \nhey maybe we can invest in some spill proof cups for the break \nroom what time does the store \nclose Hey Taylor I need need to pick up some stuff from the store nearby what \ntime does the store close if you're talking about the electronic store it closes at 900 \np.m. but if you mean the grocery store it closes at 10: p.m. it's the electronic store good we \nhave plenty of time then perfect do you know what you're getting yeah I need some new headphones \nmy old ones just broke oh I've been thinking about getting a pair too maybe we can check if \nthere are any deals sounds like a plan absolutely and while we're out \nmaybe we can stop by the grocery store too we're out of snacks for movie \nnight good idea let's make it a productive \nevening I think I've caught a \ncold H I think I've got a cold I've been sneezing all morning and \nmy throat feels scratchy oh no that's not good have you \ntaken any medicine not yet I might head to the pharmacy during my lunch break you \nshould definitely do that and maybe consider working from home tomorrow just \nto be safe I was thinking the same I don't want to sprad it around the \noffice that's thoughtful of you make sure to get plenty of rest to drink lots of fluids \nI will thanks for the advice Jordan no problem and if you need any help covering your tasks while you're \nout just let me know I appreciate that hopefully it's just a 24-hour thing and \nI'll be back at no \ntime jump on the \nbandwagon have you noticed how everyone sudden into rollerblading these days oh \ntotally it's like they've all decided to jump on the bandwagon \nexactly just last month no one even mentioned it and now look \naround it's funny how Trends work one minute something's outdated and the next \neveryone's doing it so are you thinking of jumping on the bandwagon too maybe it does look fun and it's good \nexercise what about you I used to rollerblade as a kid might pick it up \nagain but not just because it's trendy that's the spirit do it because \nyou enjoy it not because everyone else is doing \nit these dancers are like \nfamily you seem a bit nervous Leo everything all right just the usual \nJitters but when I look around and see everyone here it's comforting these dancers are like \nfamily I know what you mean we've been through so much together rehearsals tours injuries and \ncelebrations absolutely remember that time the music stopped mid performance and we all just \nimprovised how could I forget that was epic it's moments like that which really \nBond us together couldn't agree more having a supportive dance family makes the \nchalleng is worth it so true let's give our best tonight and for each other and for the \naudience always let's do [Music] \nthis I need to clean my \nroom ug I've been procrastinating all week I need to clean my \nroom tell me about it I always find some excuse not to do it do you need \nhelp would you that'd be amazing but only if you promise not to \nlaugh at my mess deal but you have to help me clean my place next weekend sounds \nfair we can turn it into a cleaning party music snacks and all \nI'm in cleaning is so much better with company plus I bet we'll find some \nforgotten Treasures in our mess oh for sure last time I found a \npair of earrings I thought I had lost forever see there's always a silver \nlining let's tackle that mess [Music] \ntogether shape up or ship \nout our project performance is really not meeting the expectations Robert the team \nneeds to shape up or ship out I understand the concerns Jessica it's \nhigh time we pulled our socks up do you think a team building exercise would help it might but everyone needs to \nunderstand the gravity of the situation we are all accountable for our \nresponsibilities absolutely let's ensure everyone understands their roles and the quality \nexpected we could maybe set clear goals for the team that sounds like a step in the \nright direction clear goals and regular check-ins could indeed drive better \nperformance and maybe we can also have an open Forum where team members can discuss their concerns or suggestions \nfor improvement great idea encouraging open dialogue can \ncertainly help in identifying and addressing any issues hampering our performance \nlet's work together to get the team back on track agreed let's shape up and deliver an outstanding \n[Music] \nproject that's the end of the video thank you for watching Remember to practice English \nevery day to improve your skills watch the
