    "transcript": "[Music] \nwell hello everyone I'm Jessica and this \nis \nAndrew today in this video we are going \nto do a typical interview about pets and \nanimals so take your time sit back and \nenjoy the video if you guys want \nsomething more challenging you can list \noff all of the questions that is in the \nvideo so you can use it for your own \nvideo to show your \nopinion it's not compatible it's up to \nyou okay so let's \n[Music] \nbegin well hello so the first question \nis what is one of your favorite animals \nwhy do you like it I like cats cats are \ngood pets yeah if like you're out all \nday they can take care of themselves so \nlong as you got like a nice sunny spot \nand something for them to scratch up \nyeah cats are cool do you have a cats as \na pet I don't have any pets um back in \nthe States um my family has two cats if \nyou turn into an animal which animal \nwould you \nbe being a human is a really good deal I \nlike I feel like being a dog would not \nbe that bad assuming that you were born \nin like Finland or something you know \ndifferent cultures respect or or treat \nanimals very very \ndifferently if there's any ounce of \nTruth to Buddhism hopefully I'm I'm \ndoing things right so I don't have to \never consider that question um so I keep \nmoving up I keep leveling up with my \nexperience points of reaching towards \nNirvana anyway I don't know what is the \ndifference between a pet and the wild \nanimal \npets usually are domesticated versus \nwild animals are wild by by Nature \nliterally and figuratively by nature and \nhopefully if you're being a responsible \nowner your domesticated pet has received \nall the various vaccinations shots and \nwhatnot to ensure that it's not likely \nto um transmit any sort of diseases \nversus wild animals well they don't get \nthat medical care so wild animals tend \nto be a lot more dangerous for the \ndiseases that they can carry most \nnotable of which would be \nrabies what can children learn by having \na \npet two things come to mind first off is \nsome degree of responsibility if they \nare required to take care of the pet to \nany extent but likewise they can learn \nthat from doing household chores so yeah \nthey're not they don't require a better \nthan that secondarily consequences for \nactions so if a child say I don't know \nYanks on the tail of the dog and the dog \ngoes around and you know retaliates in \nsome way cause and effect they realize \nthere are consequences for their actions \nbut again any way they can learn this \nyou've pet a cat before right and then \nthey they're happy and happy and happy \nfor a little bit and then they started \nlike get this little look in their face \nand they're like oh I should really stop \npetting you but I'm kind of liking it \nand then before you know the cat turns \naround bites you and Claws and all that \nso I suppose that's where you start to \nalso learn to pay attention to your \nsurroundings otherwise potential painful \nconsequences maybe around the corner \nisn't this too much for children I don't \nknow some of you people like high school \nUniversity age \nright have you ever been to a zoo yes \nI've been to a few different zoos how \nwas \nit Bleak bismal uh border line I it's \nnot not a place I would want to go again \num it's it's yeah I've I've been to \nhappier place I've certainly been to \nGreener places should animals be kept in \nthe \nzoo there are pluses and negatives um \nand zoos animals can get certain amounts \nof healthare Etc um Rehabilitation \nthings of that sort as well endangered \nspecies can be kind of guided back from \nthe the rink of Extinction potentially \num but if we're being responsible to \nhuman beings we're not putting them in \nthat situation in the first place so if \nyou do it right it can be a positive \nthing but I think a lot of people don't \ndo it right \ndo you think the most important thing by \nwhich Psychopaths can be recognized is \nthe attitude toward \nanimals okay um so first I word \npsychopath has two parts psycho which \nmeans mind and path which refers to \ncathology or illness of some kind so it \nmeans somebody with any kind of mental \nillness mental illness is a broad \nspectrum and some people have mental \nillness where \nclearly it makes them very \nantisocial but the vast majority of \npeople who have any degree of mental \nillness are not like that they exist \nmuch more on a a normal spectrum and you \nwouldn't know that they have any kind of \nmental illness um so let's just clarify \nwith \nthat um now that being said for people \nwho are expected to become or were \nexpected to be exceptionally antisocial \nyes it's seen as an indicator or \npredictor there's a legitimate checklist \nthat we have for people that who are \nlikely to become serial \nkillers um and one of the things on that \nlist is that they derive pleasure from \nthe torture or killing of animals just \nfor the sake of torturing and killing \nthose animals it doesn't mean like \nhunting and killing as sports that's \ndifferent doesn't mean um killing for \nfor meat that's different \nit doesn't mean um killing and torturing \nas is conducted in Vietnam like say for \ndog meat dogs are tortured before \nkilling so that way they release \nadrenaline and supposedly makes the meat \ntaste better or I've seen people torture \nand kill like mice in their home to make \nthe mouse squeak and squeal and scream \nand Agony and death throws and all that \nand I I was told they do that because \nthe other mice can hear this and realize \nthey don't want to have the same fate \nfor themselves I don't know if that's \ncorrect but I've seen enough YouTube \nvideos and things like that that I I \ndon't think it's just \nhearsay um so again those are different \nfrom Simply torturing and killing \nanimals for the sake of torturing and \nkilling animals in one's own \namus do you think it is acceptable to \ntest Cosmetics on \nanimals testing Cosmetics on animals uh \nI think that if we don't test Cosmetics \non animals then they're just going to be \ntested on the general public that being \nsaid um there are a lot of tests that \ncan be done before they are tested on \nanimals to ensure that they will be as \nsafe as feasibly possible on those \nanimals and that animal testing is a \nfairly archaic way of testing \nproducts and as technology develops and \nadvances we're going to find we have \nways of testing products that don't \nrequire animals and as soon as we can do \nthat the better you know if we can phase \npast testing on animals then that would \nbe \nideal how do you feel about the use of \nanimals for medical \nresearch same as testing the Cosmetics \nit's something that's useful in some \nextent to some extents but again it's \naaic and as we develop more technology \nwe can move past it the one thing that \nhas a bit of an issue is when people \nstart testing like dietary components on \nanimals like quite some years ago the \nthere was a test done on using \nartificial sugars with rats and the use \nof the artificial in artificial sugars \nand rats led to um cancer in those \nrats and then of course the media saw \nthis and they took it and they blew it \nall out of proportion saying these \nartificial sugars instantaneously cause \ncancer and blah blah blah which is \nnonsense cuz the volume of that \nartificial sugar that they were using on \na rat you would have to drink like 400 \ncans of Diet Coke each day day to obtain \nto to take in the same volume of the \nartificial sugars so it does serve some \npurpose but too easily what's tested on \nanimals and seen in animals is Mis \nextrapolated um in understanding \npotential effects on humans so that has \na definite \nnegative some people think that people \nshouldn't wear animal fur do you \nagree and why why not \ntwo things first might be that um yeah \nit's horrific to to slaughter animals \nfor or actually the thing is that quite \noften these fures are not taken from \ndead animals right literally they will \nrip the skin off of a living animal to \nmake that kind of jacket and it's not \nyeah you're should be like exactly like \nif you were to try and take something to \npeel a potato or peel a carrot and \nimagine taking that to your it's the \nsame concept it's not a happy notion \nright um so that's horrific opposite end \nyou're right this might not be okay for \nkids opposite end is that if an animal \nhas died or has been killed for meat or \nvarious other components it makes sense \nto me to then use every single gram of \nthat animal to the fullest extent to be \nable to show Almost respect for the \nsacrifice that was made but again it's \nfairly AR we're learning to to be able \nto um develop meats and leathers and \nartificial manifestations of biological \ncomponents inside laboratory settings so \nat some point we more need to bother \nwith \n[Music] \nit okay I think that's all thanks again \nfor listening don't miss our next \nepisodes until next time keep enjoying \nEnglish and learning English with \nJessica \n[Music] \n"
