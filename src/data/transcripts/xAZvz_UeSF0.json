mary hi mary how are you \nsorry but who is that it's kenny \ndo you remember me kenny you're kenny from high school in \ncolchester aren't you that's right it's me \noh it's been almost six years since i last saw you how do you have my contact \nkate your college friend is my colleague oh what a coincidence \nyeah i accidentally saw your photo on her facebook the other day \n[Music] so i asked her for your number \nreally how have you been i'm doing fine \ni'm working in london how about you i'm working in manchester \noh really i thought you were in london too so we could meet up \ni have a business trip next week to london so i can go out at night \noh that's great which evening are you free let me see \nmaybe wednesday or thursday night would be fine good then let's meet up on wednesday \nnight let me invite some of my classmates to a class reunion \noh do you still keep in touch with them yeah \njust a few friends we still see each other often \nyeah oh it's gonna be fun well where in london will you stay so i could \narrange the meeting near you oh that's okay you can just pick a place \nthat's convenient for everyone no we're living here so \nit's easier for us to get there where will you stay \ni will stay near king's cross station okay \ni'll find a location and get back to you with the time and address \nokay thank you not at all so i'll get back to you later \nyeah talk later bye bye \n[Music] \nhey stacy look that's ash she is from class 1a she dyed her hair purple \ndoes our school not allow students to dye their hair wow that's definitely her \nshe looks amazing though purple sits here but i think she needs to follow the \nrules rules are rules and you're not supposed to break them i think she will need to meet with the \nheadmaster tomorrow regarding her hair but still i think that rule is a bit ridiculous \ndying your hair does not mean you're a bad person it is just a way of showing your own \nstyle i beg to differ dying hair costs money \nit is like you are showing off and you just want to look different at school it does not show any consideration to \nyour friends at all but what if she dyed her own hair it would not cost as much if you do it \nyourself well i still think it is not a correct manner for students \nschool is where you're supposed to look decent not stylish it just adds more colors \nshe would still wear her uniforms i guess we will forever argue about this \nsome of your points are right but i still stand by mine the rule is necessary \nyeah we might get into a fight if we argue more let's drop it here \nwanna get ice cream sure let's go [Music] \nSLOW COMPUTER \nslow computer [Music] \nwhy are you so angry mary i'm okay mia i'm just pissed off with my \nlaptop what's wrong with that it is

reason but it still works fine months ago \nhave you checked the window update yes i updated \nnow you mentioned it i realized it started to be slow after the update \nmaybe your laptop is not strong enough for the new window update or there is an error \nmaybe do you know how to get back to the old version i don't know mary \nbut is it that slow yes \nit's nearly stops every single time i opened a folder \n[Music] why don't you buy a new laptop \nof course i want to but i don't have enough money for a new laptop now \nwell in that case you should take it to a store and have it fixed \nyeah i
