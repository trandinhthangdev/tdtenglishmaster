the details \nwell it has been raining all night and has just stopped and i really like the smell of the air after the rain \nso when only three blocks left to your home i decided to walk instead of keeping in a cab \nand unluckily when it was only one block away from your house the street light \nwas out and was so quiet one man with a knife suddenly stopped me and told me to give him my purse i was freaking out \nthere and i gave him it right after why didn't you fight back you've learned \nkickboxing for five years he had a knife nicole \nwho knew what could happen plus i didn't bring much money and my phone was old \nthen he looked at me and thought back he threatened and made me follow him into a small alley nearby \ni felt some things not right here and refused i was scared that maybe he wanted to rape me i didn't have any \nchoice i took the opportunity and punched him right in the face nose and throat gave him some kicks also beat him \nto the ground took my purse back and ran straight to your house \ndidn't you get hurt nah i'm fine i think we should call the police \npossibly he went after you and could be somewhere around out here yeah you were \nright let's call them \nselling a house dialogue one hiring the broker \n[Music] \nhello this is one mount properties how may i help you hello i'm moving in a few months so i'm \nlooking to sell my current house because this might take a lot of time and i'm not very knowledgeable about \nselling because this might take a lot of time and i'm not very knowledgeable about selling process \ni would like to hire an agent to help me sell my house certainly that's why we're here first \ncould i have your name please i'm jim chen mr chen could you tell me more about \nyour current house it's a two beds two bath house in west \nphilly my wife and i have only stayed there for two years we're hoping we can sell it for six hundred fifty thousand \ndollars that's a bit higher than the market price but we'll need to view the house \nbefore we can decide anything of course can you come over this saturday at 2 p.m \n2 p.m is perfect great i'll email you the address and directions to my house later \nthank you we'll send you information about the contract let's talk more when we meet \nalright thanks [Music] \ndialog 2 marketing the house \n[Music] good afternoon mr chen i'm harris from \none mount properties hello harris just call me jim please thanks for coming \nmy pleasure your house looks splendid seems like it's in great shape \nthanks shall we go inside of course [Music] \nthis is our living room the kitchen and dining room are over there the bathroom is on the right and there's \nanother bathroom on the second floor let's go upstairs okay everything looks great so far \nthis is our bedroom the bathroom is right next to it and over there is the bedroom for guests \nit's a bit smaller thanks for showing me the house it looks amazing \nthanks when can you start showing the house what do i need to do we just need some home upgrades and then \ni can start showing the house next month you don't have to be here when prospective buyers come over to view the \nhouse please leave everything to us we'll take care of every detail \ni'm glad to hear that thanks [Music] \ndialog 3 setting a price [Music] \nwhat do you think of the condition of the house well let me see \nthe house is not too big but it looks new and cozy the location is also great \nthe house is close to the city center the neighborhood is safe and quiet and there are supermarkets and schools \nnearby so what price do you think is suitable can we sell the house for 650 000 \nthat's still a pretty high price compared to the prices of other houses in the area \nbut since the house is in good condition i think we can try selling it at 580 \nthousand dollars i realize that six hundred fifty thousand dollars is a bit high but \nshouldn't we set the price really high at first because the buyers will negotiate after that anyway \ni think it's best if we set a suitable price if you set a high price potential buyers may leave right away \nokay i guess that makes sense [Music] \ndialogue 4 signing the contract [Music] \nas we discussed last time one mount properties will take care of everything from a to z \nwe will help you stage your house and prepare it for sale as well as schedule showings and manage all the needed \npaperwork my wife and i both work full time so we don't have enough time we're here to \nhelp we can guarantee with you that we will find at least seven potential buyers for you within one month \nsounds great we'll charge a two percent commission on the final sales price of the house \nthere are more details about the payment here please go through everything and let me know if you have any questions \n[Music] okay everything looks good let's sign \nthe contract great [Music] \ndialog 5 fixing the house \nis there anything in the house you think i should prepare the house looks good overall but there \nare places you can certainly fix up if you want the house to look even better like what \nthe walls over here have some stains you can try using warm water and soap to clean and remove the stains \nthe carpet in the living room looks a bit old so maybe you should have it cleaned as well \nmy last recommendation is that you can consider changing the light bulbs to make the rooms look brighter and bigger \nthanks for your suggestions i'll fix everything as soon as i can \ndialog 6 before a house showing \nhello jim this is harris from one mount properties i have great news for you \nhi harris what is it i found two potential buyers i've scheduled a house tour with them at 10 \na.m and 12 p.m this thursday wow you've already found someone

met with them yesterday great news they are in love with the house and want \nto move in at the end of next month wow really that's great are they okay \nwith our price well they really like the house but our price \nexceeds their budget they also think the price is quite high compared to the market price so they \nwant to negotiate the price down to 570 thousand dollars \ni see but i don't think i can accept that price it's too low \nlet's try to work this out they are our best potential buyers till now because they are completely \nsatisfied with the house and want to move in right away we can close the deal quickly if we \nreduce the price a bit you're right i want to quickly sell the \nhouse i'm all right with that price wonderful [Music] \ndialog 8 after the home sale \n[Music] morning
