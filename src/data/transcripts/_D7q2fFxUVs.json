\nlike do you feel bad about yourself lonely worthless and depressed \ndo you see yourself having headaches chest pain and cold or sweaty hands and feet \nwhen you see yourself have these symptoms your body and mind really need to relax \ndon't forget that you should think positively always it is one of the best ways to avoid \nstress but you know it's not easy i cannot achieve the aims i cannot \nhey chris listen sometimes positive is not perfection sweetie \nit must be that you can accept everything you don't expect that's right if you have any problems \ndon't forget to share them

remember what happened when i \nwas four years old that's a long story come on buddy \ntell us yeah i'm really curious \nThat was when \nokay that was when i was going home on the first day of kindergarten \nit was my dad who walked me home at that time my family lived in the \ncountryside and the kindergarten was not far away from my house \nso i always went to the kindergarten on foot every day \ni told him i don't want to go to kindergarten and i prefer to stay at home \nhe said to let him discuss with mom first before answering me \nI once wished \ni once wished i had grown up in the countryside i love rice fields and camping in the \nmountain a lot i have never been to the countryside \nwill you take us there john yes but let me finish my story first \nA really weird manhole cover \nthings would go fine until we passed a really weird manhole cover \nit's painted yellow with the face of pac-man on it it i felt so funny and told my dad about \nit you're so childish john yeah i know \nchildish \nbut the story was not just that my dad turned to a poker face and he \ntold me he would reveal the truth he said he wasn't my own father \nbut he had brought me home from that manhole cover on a summer night \nno way \nmom didn't tell me because she was afraid i would be sad what \nno way did you believe that of course yes \nmy parents had never lied to me before and i trusted them \ni was shocked by this and cried a lot on the way home [Music] \nmy dad \nmy dad said i shouldn't be worried because my parents loved me a lot and \nwould never abandon me but i was still scared i told him i would be obedient and went \nto the kindergarten your dad shouldn't have told you that \nthat's hurtful i agree yeah after that i became an obedient \nI agree \nchild because i was scared of being kicked out of my house this is why i didn't dare tell my mom \nuntil i entered primary school my new grade one teacher asked the whole \nclass on day one to write down our birthday on the class information paper \ni told her i don't have a real birthday and this is a complicated story \nA complicated story \nwas she angry no she tried to ask me but i didn't tell \nher anything and then one of my friends from the kindergarten \nsaid loudly before the class he doesn't know his birthday because his \nparents brought him home from the pac-man manhole cover nobody knows his birthday \nWhat did your teacher do \nwhat did your teacher do at that time the teacher was confused \nafter class she called my mom to clarify it my mom had no idea what was going on she \nwas like what no way he's my son my only son and i gave birth \nto him your dad should be worried \nYour dad should be worried \nyeah the rage of that woman my mom then scolded my dad a lot for \nsaying that and didn't say a word to him for a month [Music] \nFor a month \nfor me i felt serene because finally i knew that i was my mom's true son \nwow i didn't expect that you could believe it for so many years \ni was also told a lie once when i was a kid but it didn't hurt as much as you \ntell us your story okay when i was a kid my mom and i lived in \nmy grandparents house because my dad was away they had a cat called mina a female one \nThey had a cat \ni felt so lonely because i didn't know those kids in the neighborhood and she was there to cheer me up and play with \nme however one morning after waking up i tried to \nfind her as usual but i found out she had disappeared \nDid she leave \ndid she leave yeah kind of \ni asked my mom where she was and my mom told me that nina had head to \nlos angeles with her godmother she wanted to become an actress \nI did believe \nwhat the cat wanted to become an actress ridiculous \nat that age i did believe that i could talk to her for real although i lost my best friend i \nconvinced myself that was good for her because she might become a superstar one day \nyou're such a girl with an angelic heart lucy i agree \nI agreed \nyou guys know what two years later i thought it was mina when i saw a poster from the movie dog \nand cat i still wondered if i might be wrong until the day came out to the public \nwhen i saw mina acting in that movie i was so moved my little sister did it \nshe finally became an actress i boasted about this all over the school \nand felt so proud until until \nI thought it was Mina \nuntil i was in grade 8 my family went to my grandparents house to celebrate \nthanksgiving i told my grandpa about the successful actress mina but he turned to me and \nsaid with a gentle voice my sweetie i'm sorry but nina died on \nthe night before the day when your mother told you she was away [Music] \nMy dear Lucy \noh my dear lucy it is such a sad story \nyeah i felt truly depressed after that what about you clark did you have any \nsimilar experiences with us when i was a little kid like you guys \ni was really curious about my parents occupations i asked dad hey dad \nwhat do you do for a living and he told me he was an architect \nhe still loves his job until today however when i asked him about my mom's \njob he didn't answer i cried and forced him to tell me mom's \njob or i would never play with him again he laughed and murmured your mother's \noccupation is top secret you mustn't tell this to anyone okay \nokay daddy you have my words i said then he put an arm onto my shoulder and said \nyour mom works for the cia remember to keep it a secret because if \nother people know it your mom will get into a lot of trouble \nKeep it a secret \nand you believed that of course for six years \nsix years that i kept my mom's secret job you didn't ask your mom about it did you \nStory time \nhe didn't do it you know him john finally i found out the truth \none day my family went to the ice cream shop i turned to my mom and smiled \nhey mom i know your secret you don't have to hide it from me \ni'll protect you mom was like what are you talking about clark \ni told her dad had told me the truth and she worked for the cia \nand promised her i wouldn't tell anyone from six years ago \nmom was angry and scolded dad on the way home he laughed ha ha \nit was a kid's story long ago i

extremely interesting topic in daily life \neveryone has a passion for decorating their own house let's watch the video to see conversations about interior decoration \nsituation one decorate a new apartment \nsophia the new apartment will be available in a month i think it's time for us to discuss the interior design \njoe i was going to tell you these days i have been looking at many different designs online \nhere are some styles i feel interested in okay show me what you've got \nso this is a modern style with kind of white plain walls a darker color tone \nfor furniture and a lot of glasses and marble flooring \nto be honest it looks great i love simplicity however we plan to have a \nbaby in the near future so do you think we should try something a little bit softer \nyou were right how about this traditional style with a \nneutral color tone with floral patterns looks a bit old-fashioned to me \nyou like this style don't you um not really i just like the cozy feeling \nso do i i prefer something that makes me feel at home any other options that are both modern \nand cozy yes this one what do you think it still looks simple \nand modern but a lot cozier with a warmer color light gray or \nbrownie is trending this year i like this one especially the wooden \nflooring we can use it for bedrooms very affordable i want to have carpet in the \nliving room alright how about the kitchen i want material that is easy to clean \nand waterproof right how about the color i'm into brown \nor beige colors like this one me too in short our taste is modern but \ncozy neutral brown beige tone then i think wooden furniture will be an \nexcellent match sure i will note it down we will discuss a detailed design \ntomorrow okay yes i will do more research \nsituation 2 decorating the room for a baby girl \n[Music] hi anna how are you hi kate i'm great and you come in \nare you back from work just now i'm good and yes i haven't seen you for \nmonths too busy with the

redecorating a bedroom for my little one \noh really how is it going it must be the cutest room in the house \nwe have just started recently how was your plan for the baby girls room \nwe always like minimalism you know so the room style will match with other \nrooms also three walls are light brown and one wall \nis white the floor will be covered with beige carpet and a white fur rug \nnice that's very modern and cute at the same time what are there in the room i can see the \ncrib over there i try to only put necessary kinds of stuff \nthere will be a crib a medium-sized wardrobe for clothes and a small cabinet \nfor things like diapers or little things for the baby all in white \nwait you mentioned one white wall before that right why only one \ngood question i intended to put a huge wooden shelf that has the size of the whole wall \nwhat is it for for children's books and toys and for decorating purposes also i think books \nand toys are very colorful so they will be stand out on the white wall \nvery unique idea my friends usually spend the wall on cute stickers \ni also decorate other walls with cute pictures of animals but also in a minimalism style \nah i forgot to mention a chair that's all have you bought all those furniture \nyes i have not many though the only thing that takes time is painting in the \nbig shelf sounds like a very lovely room remember to

often feed chickens ducks sheep rabbits cows and so on \nafter that they water their trees it may take them a lot of time and energy \nwhen the fruit is ripe they will harvest it and sell it to the merchants similarly they will sell the animals \nwhen they grow up besides farmers have to protect their plants from bad weather it seems to be a \ndifficult task for them this is some information about farmers daily life \nthank you teacher who has any questions for me about jobs \nno we don't okay our lesson ends here \nplease remember to do your homework i'll check it in the next day now you can go home \ngoodbye bye see you next time \n[Music] at the hair salon \nhaving haircut and nails done is always a favorite of the majority of women \nlet's watch the video to see some conversations

and blonde balayage \nwill fit you best can you show me a photo of that hair color \nsure this is a photo from one of my customers wow her hair looks stunning i love that \nbrown color fading into buttery blonde tones let's do this \n[Music] however since your hair has a dark color and balayage requires lightening \ni will need to have some part of your hair bleached is that okay \nis it bad for my hair the bleach part will be drier \nhowever consider that you have pretty strong hair i think it's okay as long as you \ncan take care of your hair well anyway i will apply conditioner

healthcare in daily life watch the video and learn the name of \nherbs and spices they mention situation one \nfavorite herbs and spices \nhi linda what are you doing hi jane i'm cooking for lunch \noh wow i see you have a lot of thyme what will you do with them \nah these are my favorite herbs when cooking whenever i make something especially \nbake or stew something surely i use it that sounds good \ndo you like herbs for cooking um not really to be honest i find them \nquite hard to mix with ingredients really i think it's quite interesting it boosts \nthe taste and smell of the dish greatly i thought so too and i tried \nmaybe i mixed the ingredients together the wrong way it was pretty bad \ni don't think i'm good at cooking each herb or spice is suitable for each \nparticular dish if you mix it wrong the taste will be difficult to eat \nfor example thyme my favorite one it is especially suitable for dishes that will require a \nlong cooking time such as baking or stewing it will create an aroma like a \ncombination of sweet and a little spicy oh i had no idea about that \nwhat ingredients will you cook with them there are a lot of things such as \ncarrots potatoes tomatoes beef chicken lamb onion \namazing yes i also love some peppermill on the stew it smells really good \nah i tried it pretty good absolutely peppermill will make your dishes better \nbecause it has a special spicy taste not too strong people who can't eat spicy food can also \ntry it great you are very knowledgeable about cooking \nhey it's my hobby \nsituation 2 buy ingredients in the supermarket \n[Music] hi jane long time no see \nhi linda what are you doing here i'm buying some ingredients to prepare \nto make a beef steak for dinner my dad really loves it but this is the first time i tried to make it on my own \nthat sounds really good so what have you bought not much i just have beef sugar and \nwhat is that uh salt oh i don't know how to make it \ni think it's quite easy i've learned the recipe on the internet the most important thing is having \nenough ingredients including herbs and spices amazing so what are they \nbeef of course yeah i know and sugar salt chili powder garlic \npowder onion powder and turmeric oh my god a lot of things \nyes is that enough no you also need fresh herbs \nfresh herbs what are they they taste best when sprinkled over meat just before serving \nthey taste fantastic with steak burgers and any grilled beef that sounds great \nso what kinds of them we need chives basil \ncoriander parsley what do you need them for \nwell they are marinated with beef to make the flavor more fragrant \nhow about thyme i've heard beef steak can't taste good if it doesn't have it \nthat's right i am finding them here so many things \ni think it's enough other things i already have at home ah i forgot cinnamon \nit really takes a lot of time to prepare the ingredients but cooking the dish is quite easy \nokay when we have free time can you teach me to cook it sure \nthanks new year's resolution \nsimple future tense new year symbolizes motivation for many \nnew beginnings new year's resolution is a promise a person makes for the
