i accidentally left my books on the table and so my cat made a scratch on the cover of one of the books \ni'm really sorry ah okay can i see the book \ni borrowed three books and this is the one that got a scratch okay \nso the scratch is not too big which is a good thing but i'm afraid we still have to charge \nyou a fine according to the library's policies i understand how much do i need to pay \nthen the processing fee is five dollars and the fine for damaged covers is five \ndollars so you'll need to pay ten dollars in total okay here you are i'm sorry again for \nbeing so careless don't worry too much thank you for letting me know of the problem right \naway try to be more careful next time i will thank you \n[Music] \ndo you want something to drink sarah visits delsi's house and they are \ndiscussing their drinks it is really nice to see you again \ncome in please hi thank you for inviting me to your home \ndo you want something to drink yes thank you that would be nice can i have a cup \nof lemon juice yes sure is it not too much trouble \ndon't worry i go shopping every day and buy a lot of lemons \n[Music] is lemon juice your favorite \nyes lemon juice is a very nice drink and i frequently drink this to meet the thirst \nand to get some nutrients as well the preparation process is so simple \nthat you would be amazed at it there are some health benefits of this juice \nand whenever i go out i keep it with me in a bottle why don't you buy it at the market \nwell sometimes if i don't have time to make it i will buy the juice from stores \nand it is then known as lemonade but those are found in the stores come \nwith too much addition of sugar that's true it is quite sweet \nso i try to avoid them but when i have no other ways or i forget to bring the juice from my home i \nneed to buy a cup of lemonade yes true lemon juice is very healthy for our body \nlemon juice is also beneficial for digestion and skin so this is a preferred drink for people \nof all ages particularly those who are cautious about their health \ndon't you have any problems with your health not at all i always try to keep my body fit and \nhealthy i mostly drink it for hydration lemon juice is also beneficial for \npeople suffering from the insufficiency of vitamin c oh that's true \nbesides often patients with kidney stones are also suggested to drink this lemon juice \nto get rid of the stones when did you start drinking lemon juice \nbefore drinking the lemon juice i was addicted to different types of beverages like cola drinks soda water etc \nbut i realized that none of those were able to meet my thirst \nthey were filled with some flavors and sugars only this is really healthy easy to prepare \nand preserve what about you what do you like to drink \nmy favorite drink is diet coke i love diet coke are you serious \nyes but a couple of years ago i was drinking only diet coke and started to realize \nthat that probably was not the healthiest thing for me to be drinking so i switched to oolong tea \nwhy did you choose oolong tea so there are a couple of benefits \none benefit which is i really like is that it absorbs the fat \nor when you're eating foods that are high in fat and drinking it with oolong for some reason it absorbs some of the \nfat so there have been studies that prove that oolong tea does contribute to \nweight loss oh really i didn't know that \nthat's why if you go to a lot of chinese restaurants they'll always serve tea with the meal and most likely it's \noolong tea because for some reason it absorbs fat \nwow that's cool plus oolong tea also has antioxidants \nwhich are cancer fighting and makes it so much healthier so it fights fat and cancer \ndon't you drink other kinds of drinks well in my research on the healthiest \ndrink i also found that green tea was even healthier than oolong tea so now i drink oolong tea green tea \nand always a bit of diet coke is green tea good for health \nthey did a study of green tea and found that people who drink green tea lost more weight than people who weren't \ndrinking green tea so anything that either absorbs fat and contributes to \nweight loss is a drink for me okay but i thought green tea had a lot of \ncaffeine in it so i thought actually that green tea was maybe not the best tea to be drinking \nif you look at it on a scale of drinks like tea and coffee and green tea and oolong tea the drink that has the least \namount of caffeine is actually green tea and that is because it's not \nprocessed what do you mean so the leaves are just dried \nthen the next drink that has more caffeine is oolong tea because the leaves are semi-processed \nafter that the drink that has more caffeine is coffee actually obviously \neveryone knows coffee has a lot of caffeine but the drink that has the most caffeine is english tea \nokay don't you drink a lot of water every day yes i guess about three liters \nso six of those 500 milliliters five or six of those 500 milliliter bottles \nyeah that's a lot that's about what i drink yeah i think i'm addicted to water \ni definitely am yeah it's my security blanket \ni must always have a bottle of water nearby to drink and you have a theory about why i always \nfeel like i get thirstier the more water i drink and do you have a theory about that don't you \nyeah that's right i think that the water bottle people somehow put a special chemical that \nalways makes you want to drink more water i agree \nyeah because haven't you noticed that if you drink water from a tap from the sink you have a glass of water \nyou're not thirsty after you finish the glass but when you finish a bottle of water \nyou're still thirsty one bottle is not enough yeah definitely \na glass of tap water i would rarely finish the glass but a bottle of bottled water i need \nmore and like you said i need to know there is more close to me \nor i get upset [Music] \nthanks for watching don't forget to like share comment on my
