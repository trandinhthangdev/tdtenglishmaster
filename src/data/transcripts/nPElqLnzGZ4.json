is on a student exchange to america \nthere she meets jessica \none of the regular students at the \nschool \njessica offers to show celine around the \ncampus and help her get used to life at \nan american university \nhello you must be celine right \nvery nice to meet you my name is jessica \ni was assigned to be your guide during \nyour stay here \nwere you informed about that \nyes i received an email with your \ninformation before my flight \nreally nice to meet you too \ni was just about to go look for you \nafter i finished unpacking \ni'm sorry you had to come find me \noh don't worry about it i was excited to \nmeet a new friend so i rushed here as \nsoon as i heard you arrived \nthat's really sweet \nwould you like to come in i've got one \nmore suitcase to unpack then i'm done \n[Music] \nsure do you need any help \nit's all good i just need to put these \nshirts away \nwow that shirt is bright orange \ninteresting choice \ni wouldn't normally choose this color \nfor myself but it is important to us \ndutch people \nwe all wear it on king's day \nwhat is king's day \nthat sounds fun i imagine there would be \na lot of drinking yes \noh yes a lot of it \n18 is the legal age to consume alcohol \nin our country so we college students \ncan also participate \ni see \nhere you need to be at least 21. \ni'm sure there are many other fun \nactivities though right \ndefinitely you know what \nwhy don't you finish unpacking then i'll \nshow you around the campus \nit is very big so i think giving you a \ntour now would ensure you don't get lost \nin the next few months \nthat would be lovely just give me a \nminute \n[Music] \nso this is the cafeteria where you can \nget your daily meals \nwow it's so nice that the cafeteria is \nright next to the dorm \nso convenient \ni agree \nit's a buffet as well \nyou can buy a meal plan for the whole \nyear and just go in and get your food \nit's different in the netherlands \nwe normally have to rent rooms outside \nof the campus and cook for ourselves \nthe cafeterias are more for snacks and \ndrinks \nthey do sell meals as well but they're \nrather expensive and offers limited \ndishes \nyou must spend a lot of time cooking \nyes it is very time consuming but also \ncan be a fun activity when friends are \nover still i wouldn't be able to do that \nmyself \nstudents can choose to rent apartments \noutside of the campus here too \nbut because i am a terrible cook i don't \nthink that's a good option for me \ni wasn't good at cooking either but you \njust have to learn \ni know \nbut maybe after college \nthis is our school stadium \nit's really huge \nyes \ncollege football is very popular \nit's pretty strong \nthere's a game night next week you \nshould come \ni will i heard it's a lot of fun we \ndon't really have such events in the \nnetherlands \noh really \nwhat sports do you guys play there then \ni'm not too sure \ni only heard rowing is pretty big among \nthe people in my school \nbut they normally form teams outside of \nthe school so there are no games \nthat's too bad \nthey are really fun \nyou know what \nmy friends and i are all going we plan \nto go get fast food after the game as \nwell \ndo you want to join oh my god yes \nthank you for inviting me \nof course i can't wait to introduce you \nto the rest of the group they're all \nreally chill \ni think you'll fit in just fine \nthat sounds nice will you please text me \nthe exact time and date \ndefinitely i'll do it after we finish \nthis tour \n[Music] \nokay here we go \nmy least favorite place in the entire \nschool \nthe library \nduh i only ever go here when i need to \ncram for exams \nand those times are not particularly \nenjoyable \ndo you know how many all-nighters i \npulled last semester \nno but don't tell me i don't want to \nknow \nme neither talking about it gives me \nnightmares \nwhat about you \ndon't tell me you like the library \ni wouldn't say so but i don't hate it \neither \ni actually don't go there to study much \nbecause it is normally not open 24 7 \nlike it is here \ni prefer to stay home and study at my \nown desk \nugh i can't do that i would constantly \nbe distracted \nyes some of my friends are like that as \nwell but i find studying at home quite \nrelaxing because it is quiet and i can \nmove around as much as i want without \nbothering others \ngood point \none time i forgot to plug in my \nheadphones \n[Music] \nin the library \nit was one of the most embarrassing \nmoments of my life \nah it's okay i'm sure people understood \nyeah well i got over it \ndo you want to go to the library \ntogether to study sometime though \nit can be a good group activity \nsure i think we can even book our own \nroom in the library right \nyes but we have to be quick if not \nthere's normally a long line for that \nlet me know when you want to go i'm \nalways up for it \n[Music] \nthank you again for giving that tour \nsee you around jessica \nyou're welcome i hope you'll have a \ngreat time here celine see you \n[Music] \nthanks for watching \ndon't forget to like share \ncomment on my video \nplease subscribe to
