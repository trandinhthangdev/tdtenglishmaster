\nrelated purposes or formal communication \nis it the email address the company gave \nme \nthat's right \nfor all the work related matters you \nneed to use that email address \nokay I got it \nevery email needs to have a subject line \nyou need to write it concise informative \nsubject line \nit is a short phrase that summarizes the \nreason for your email message \nfor example can I write it like this \nrevenue reports third quarter 2022. \nyou are learning fast \nthank you \nwhen you click reply all you must be \ncareful \nbecause that means you've emailed your \nresponse to both the sender of the \nprevious message and everyone who \nreceived the original email \nokay I'll keep this in mind \nyou also need to create your personal \nemail signature \ndo you know how to create one \nyes I do \nis there anything I need to pay special \nattention to \nit should include your full name job \ntitle a photo of yourself a direct phone \nnumber and a hyperlinked website address \na professional signature allows you to \npromote your brand and Company \noh I'm still missing the website address \nI will add it later \nwhen you write an email you should begin \nwith an appropriate greeting \nslang overly friendly or overly stiff \nlanguage must always be avoided \nI see \nif so I bet I can't use interjections or \nexclamation points either right \nthat's right \nyou should keep everything short simple \nand formal \nand if you write an email to foreign \nclients you should pay attention to \ncultural differences to avoid \nunnecessary problems \nsuch useful knowledge thank you for \ntelling me this \nno problem \nand last but not least you must always \ndouble check everything before sending \nit \nthank you Anna now I can write a proper \nand

a great chance for me to \npractice \nwhat do you want me to write about \nI want to email my best friend from \nmiddle school \nshe is living abroad now I haven't \ntalked to her for a long time \nI want to know how she is doing \nthat's it is there anything else you \nwant to write \nah \nI want her to know how about my current \nlife \nlet her know that I still work as a \nteacher but now I have moved to our old \nschool \nhelp me to say that I miss her very much \n[Music] \nand I would like to invite her to come \nback here to visit my house so that we \ncan reminisce about old memories

inviting a \npresident over to my house \nwhy do you say that \nbecause it's too polite and formal not \nsuitable when talking to friends \nso what do I need to do \nthe email subject doesn't have to be \nthat complicated just keep it simple \nbut I thought it was already simple \nyou can write it shorter for example \nletter from Mary \nokay let me fix it \nanything else \nin the beginning you can use a friendly \ngreeting such as hi Susan \nit's so simple \nthis is not a work context so you can \nwrite it informally comfortable \nah so that's it \nyou should notice a few more points \nafter the greeting you can express my \napology for a long time without contact \nthen the reason for writing the email \nand finally is the invitation \nat the end of the letter use a cordial \ngreeting \nthat makes sense I know my problems \nthank you Mom \nwriting emails is so hard but I'm glad I \nlearned a new style of email writing \nforeign \n[Music] \ndon't forget to like share
