four years old \nthat's a long story \ncome on buddy \ntell us \nyeah \ni'm really curious \nokay \nthat was when i was going home on the \nfirst day of kindergarten \nit was my dad who walked me home \nat that time my family lived in the \ncountryside \nand the kindergarten was not far away \nfrom my house \nso \ni always went to the kindergarten on \nfoot every day \ni told him i don't want to go to \nkindergarten and i prefer to stay at \nhome \nhe said to let him discuss with mom \nfirst before answering me \ni once wish i had grown up in the \ncountryside \ni love rice fields and camping in the \nmountain a lot \ni have never been to the countryside \nwill you take us there john \nyes but \nlet me finish my story first \nthings would go fine until we passed a \nreally weird manhole cover \nit's painted yellow with the face of \npac-man on it \nit i felt so funny and told my dad about \nit \nyou're so childish john \nyeah i know \nbut the story was not just that \nmy dad turned to a poker face and he \ntold me he would reveal the truth \nhe said he wasn't my own father \nbut he had brought me home from that \nmanhole cover on a summer night \nmom didn't tell me because she was \nafraid i would be sad \nwhat \nno way \ndid you believe that \nof course yes \nmy parents had never lied to me before \nand i trusted them \ni was shocked by this and cried a lot on \nthe way home \n[Music] \nmy dad said i shouldn't be worried \nbecause my parents loved me a lot and \nwould never abandon me \nbut i was still scared \ni told him i would be obedient and went \nto the kindergarten \nyour dad shouldn't have told you that \nthat's hurtful \ni agree \nyeah after that i became an obedient \nchild \nbecause i was scared of being kicked out \nof my house this is why i didn't dare \ntell my mom until i entered primary \nschool \nmy new grade one teacher asked the whole \nclass on day one to write down our \nbirthday on the class information paper \ni told her \ni don't have a real birthday and this is \na complicated story \nwas she angry \nno \nshe tried to ask me but i didn't tell \nher anything \nand then \none of my friends from the kindergarten \nsaid loudly before the class \nhe doesn't know his birthday because his \nparents brought him home from the \npac-man manhole cover \nnobody knows his birthday \n[Music] \nwhat did your teacher do at that time \nthe teacher was confused \nafter class she called my mom to clarify \nit \nmy mom had no idea what was going on she \nwas like what no way \nhe's my son my only son and i gave birth \nto him \nyour dad should be worried \nyeah the rage of that woman \nmy mom then scolded my dad a lot for \nsaying that and didn't say a word to him \nfor a month \n[Music] \nfor me \ni felt serene because finally \ni knew that i was my mom's true son \nwow \ni didn't expect that you could believe \nit for so many years \ni was also told a lie once when i was a \nkid but \nit didn't hurt as much as you \ntell us
