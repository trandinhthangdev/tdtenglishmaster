college and we were \nactually in a relationship for a while what so that is why Jack moved \nhere why are you only telling me this now no both Jack and I didn't know it was \njust a coincidence coincidence really do you \nthink I would believe it was just a coincidence okay Peter I admit that I \nstill have some feelings left for Jack but I swear this is all just a \ncoincidence there has been nothing between me and Jack since he moved in since when Sharon since when have you \nstarted lying to me like this I am not lying to you Peter I never \nhave you dare blame me when you are part of the reason as well oh so now you are blaming \nme is it my fault that your college sweetheart moved here no I don't mean that \nPeter I am saying that you have been neglecting me all you ever know is work eat and \nsleep in the the theater you don't care about me anymore \nwhat Peter I think we both want different things at the moment tell you what I interviewed for a \njob opening at an upcoming gallery and I got it I love this job do you get \nit what are you trying to say Sharon what I am trying to say is that I \nwant to stay here can you can you not to go to Japan and stay here with me \nPeter what kind of question is that answer me Peter can you do that it is \nvery important to me I have already accepted the job offer did you accept it \nwithout telling me why did you do that and did you ask me about auditioning for \nJapan can you please stay here with me Peter I I can't \nSharon this is a really big step in my career I can't miss \nit you see Peter I was right there is nothing more important to \nyou than your career I always knew [Music] \nit now that no one is here can I ask you something an what is it \nJack are you still mad at me not really it's hard to forget you \njust like that but I am trying if you would come into my life at a different \ntime before Sharon maybe then we could have had a chance at being \ntogether you were really an amazing woman thanks Jack I am truly happy for \nyou and Sharon after so much time apart you two are finally going to to get each other \nback I hope you two will have a happy ending oh I am not getting ahead of \nmyself this is only the start Sharon just broke up with Peter and we are both still very \nunsure it's okay just keep it natural if Alice were here she would say \nthat oh Alice I miss her jokes and pranks I know right she always has \nsomething to say and knows how to make every every one laugh I miss everybody \neven Peter in his practicing voice but it was so terrible that our \neard drums almost exploded I know but I'm used to Living \nLike That by the way how are things between you and Peter we had a long \nconversation he said it wasn't entirely my fault he realized he was too focused on \nwork and ignored Sharon's feelings and needs meanwhile I was always there for \nher instead of him I guess it's for the best anyway it's quite late I should get \ngoing oh I'm going to see a movie with Sharon tonight do you want to join no thank you I I have some stuff to \ndo just come this movie was just released I really want to but I can't I \nalready have other plans okay then

musical performance life in Japan will be great I just can't imagine life without \nyou Sharon oh it's going to be fine your voice is amazing and this move will be \nreally beneficial for your career I believe in you Peter thank you well I just want you to \nknow that this really is not an easy decision for me to make but I am sure that it is right for \nyour career and I can't be the one holding you back right now I am going to become famous and earn \nso much money that I can buy my own airplane and fly you out every \nweekend that is going to cost a lot of petrol well I will be rich by then who \ncares how much it costs okay I will wait until you are rich but in the in the meantime I will \nstill visit you maybe together with Anne I am sure you will have already \nforgotten me by the time you are famous though how can I Sharon I will never \nforget you oh can I ask something from you what is it can I have the pictures \nwe took together in Japan last time I want to hang them on the walls when I arrive at my place in \nJapan every time I miss you I will look at them they will help me a lot especially in the \nbeginning sure take them I am very glad that you still think so highly of me of \ncourse do your best Peter I will miss you I will miss you \ntoo see you Sharon I'm going to pack my bags [Music] \nnow online shopping online shopping is getting more \npopular due to its convenience and the variety of choices watch the video and \nsee how different people buy essential things on the \ninternet dialogue [Music] \none hello Taylor oh hi Veronica what are you doing \nnothing just enjoying the fresh air great well I have a favor to ask \nyou what is it I'm going to a wedding this weekend and I'm thinking of buying \nthis dress online really yes so I need your opinion \nbecause you shop online a lot and you're a fashion expert thank you for the compliment uh \nshow me the dress then here it's on Amazon \noh it's very cheap that's why I chose it you can never get a dress like this at a \nstore with such little money but it seems like it doesn't fit \nyour body type well I thought that the details are \nbeautiful you have a small and nice waist meanwhile this dress doesn't even \nhave a waistline but I can always use a belt to fix that no a belt doesn't go well with a \ndress like this I like it but it's not the perfect one for you what a Pity I \nthought I would look nice in it a lot of people think that when they \nbuy something online and then they get disappointed that's the disadvantage you \ncan't try it on first right but online shopping is more \nconvenient when you go into the stores if one shop doesn't have what you need then you'll have to go to \nanother you're right but let's find another one scroll down what about this one it can fit you \nwell but check the review first okay the comments aren't so positive \nthey say that delivery is slow and the fabric is too thin understandable the price is way too \nlow does this red one look pretty to you no it's too sparkly it's going to \nmake you look ridiculous well check this blue one \nseems good it's quite simple but formal enough for a wedding people love this one too \nalthough it's a little more expensive quality clothes online are usually \nexpensive but it's okay I can afford it thank you for your help Taylor you're \nwelcome have fun fun at the [Music] \nwedding dialog \n2 Mark have you heard the news I haven't had time why they said \nthat all stores will be closed from Tuesday that's the day after tomorrow \nright yes oh boy I bet it's because of the \npandemic indeed that's the only reason what do we do now we don't have \nthat much food left in the fridge the worst thing is that we don't \nknow when they will open again our dorm should have had a \ncanteen well the pandemic was unexpected after all but I heard that we can buy \ngroceries online are you serious of course since the pandemic a \nlot of people have opened grocery stores online I don't know the idea of buying \nmeat or vegetables on the internet seems weird to me but that's the only way Mark \nis right we don't have another Choice besides usually we still buy \nfrozen meat and packaged vegetables at the supermarket yes there's not much \ndifferent fine but we have to find a reliable shop \ntrue that's the most difficult part also known as the number one drawback of \nonline shopping does anyone have experience Britney might she's the one \nwho suggested the idea actually no I just saw some people talk about it on Twitter can you call \nyour mom or dad to ask right they probably probably know in \nmy home country there are very few cases the shops are still running let me call \nArizona might be in lockdown well then you do it it's true my mom said that the shops \nthere have been closed for almost a week oh that's really \nbad it is but the fridge at my home was quite full of course it \nis however my mom prepared for everything \nthing she already had some shops that we can buy from that's great well she told \nme that she's going to send them to me later so problem [Music] \nsolved dialogue [Music] \n3 mom I want to buy a pair of shoes shoes why so \nsudden well I'm about to go back to school and my convers are too old \nalready oh yes they are but I want to try and buy them \nonline really I'm not so sure about that why it's more convenient and there are a \nlot more options what if you buy a pair and they don't fit that would be a waste of money \nthen we can just return it back to the shop how do you know that they will let you do that I'll just ask them through \nmessages all right that's fine enough great can you help me look \nsure so I've been liking this pair of boots for a while so long they nearly reach your \nknees I know but it looks really cool don't you think so \nyes but they're super inconvenient they might take you 5 minutes to put them on wait 5 \nminutes yes putting your feet into them properly can already be a struggle plus \nI don't think it's appropriate for school then what do you think is appropriate sneakers \nperhaps I've always warned them I need a change well you can find a pair of \nsimpler boots ankle boots yes with a zipper so that it's \neasy to put on then have a look at this white pair \nso expensive that's over $90 but they're German if the quality is \ngood I can wear them for a long time there are quality boots at a cheaper price you know let me look a little more \nhow about this $50 not much cheaper but \nacceptable people's reviews say that it's worth the money okay but ask the shop if you can \nreturn it if it doesn't fit we can after that they will deliver a similar pair in \ndifferent sizes good then order \nit finished when will they be delivered well maybe in 5 days or sooner I \n[Music] \nhope talk about your experiences have you \never dialogue one have you ever watched the sunset on the sea \nyet do you have any plans for summer break I'm going to California with my \nfamily wow sounds fun it's going to be a great \nexperience indeed there are so many interesting things you can do there my \nmom said she's looking forward to seeing the sunset that's right sunsets are \nbeautiful have you ever watched the sunset on the sea yet yes but it was in \nMiami what was it like the only thing I can say is that it \nwas fascinating the way everything slowly turned darker the Shadows of the \npalm trees and mountains on the various colors on the sky wow it must be magical \nscenery we even drank beer and enjoyed some light snacks while we watched the scene it was an unforgettable \nmemory how did you feel about it it was my first time watching the sunset I felt \nreally peaceful and happy like that moment moment was everything I need in \nlife oh I understand that feeling yeah watching the sunset is \ndefinitely something you have to do at least once in your life I see well I'm about to be able to \nenjoy it make sure to take some [Music] \npictures dialogue 2 have you ever gone to a concert \noh another artist canceled their concert again \nreally yes the announcement has just been posted because of the pandemic right of \ncourse well that's so sad have you ever gone to a concert I've never even gone \nthere yes I have I've gone to one last fall when I was in New York oh the BTS \nconcert right yes did you have fun obviously I did it's my favorite boy \ngroup they're very popular so it must be very crowded indeed the stadium was packed I \nremembered how hard I and my best friend had to try to get some tickets but it was worth it \nright yes the concert was beyond amazing do do they sing well \nlive oh my God yes some songs were even better than the studio \nversion cool seems like a perfect night I've loved them since 2015 so yes I was \nso happy to see them you sound like you missed that day a lot I do the show was so good it was \nprobably one of the happiest days of my life a unique experience wasn't it true \nanyway I hope that the pandemic will end soon yes I'm planning on going to \nanother concert when everything goes back to [Music] \nnormal dialogue 3 have you ever received a present that you really \nhate have you ever received a present that you really hate actually yes when was it it was \nlast Christmas oh when I opened the box I was \nspeechless was it that bad yeah inside it was a super ugly \nsweater sweater it wasn't even knitted properly the color was hideous red with \nbrown stars all over it sounds really terrible \nthe sadder thing was that it's from my mother \nunbelievable I didn't understand how she could give that sweater to me honestly \nbut then I took it out and underneath it was a brand new pair of convers so it was just a \njoke yeah but I have to say that it's truly [Music] \ncreative dialogue 4 Have You Ever Loved \nSomeone hey I've been talking to a very nice girl online really for how long nearly 2 \nmonths but we're going to meet for the first time this weekend have you seen her \nface yes we call on FaceTime a lot wow that's good for you I think it's \ntime I should start a relationship Have You Ever Loved Someone I have oh you \nlook sad when I mentioned this do you want to talk about it actually yes you sure it's okay I \ndon't want to make you feel bad it's fine I need to talk to someone about \nthis anyway all right how did you two meet in high school we were in history \nclass together and we were partnered for a project oh a high school relationship is \nusually hard to forget you're right what happened after the \nproject well we just kind of clicked we had so much fun around each other who \nconfessed their feelings first I did I asked her to go to prom and she said \nyes later I drove her home and we said goodbye on the porch I kissed her that's \nreally sweet and then we were officially a couple in until the end of last year I'm \nreally sorry yeah it was an amazing relationship but the long distance had \nbeen very difficult for both of us I see does it seem like you still love her \nthough a little bit but the breakup was the best [Music] \noption dialogue five I have forgotten my boyfriend's birthday \nI almost forgot my mom's birthday yesterday really yes luckily my brother \nreminded me well I have forgotten my boyfriend's birthday \nonce oh that's bad too how did everything go okay so do you remember when we were \nso busy for finals last year yes it was so \nstressful there was so much work so the day went by so quickly by the time I \nremembered that it was his birthday it was already past 12 how \nunfortunate he seemed to be really mad at me he ignored me at school the following \nday so how did you fix that of course I threw him a late surprise party to make \nup for my mistake nice I apologized to him too I \nsaid that I was wrong and he's still an important person listen to me he was really moved after that he kissed me you \ntwo are really cute thank you after that I had to \nremind myself to always check the date before rushing to [Music] \nwork dialogue 6 have you ever been on TV have you ever been on TV guys no I \nhave't I have oh really when when I was in 11th \ngrade what show was that I don't remember the name but it was about a \nconference for the Youth that I joined Co so they interviewed you yes but it \nwas a brief one what did they ask just a simple question like my thoughts about \nthe conference and stuff like that you're a good speaker I but the answers were \namazing I guess you can say that my parents were so surprised when they saw \nme if I were them I would be surprised too well it was actually a nice \n[Music] \nexperience dialogue 7 have you ever had a \nmakeover Kitty have you ever had a makeover well yes why did you ask me that I've \nbeen thinking of getting a nose job a nose job at age \n16 yes and then I also need to change my style I agree about changing your style \nbut don't you think having a nose job now is a bit too soon so how did you make over \nyourself I learned makeup dyed my hair and went on a diet then I also changed \nmy style that sounds like a lot of work it did take 2 or 3 years since I can't \nget an entirely new wardrobe after I lose weight how are you feeling now after you've changed \nyourself h of course I feel a lot more confident did that confidence change \nyour life a lot definitely I socialize more take more photos and even went on a \nfew dates dates yes but I'm too busy to be in a \nrelationship seems like a makeover can really change someone's life for the better

fine I learned some \nvaluable lessons about being carefully prepared so you can count on me well \nokay then what kind of problems did you have to face first was insects they aren't harmless \nlike those in the city so make sure to bring insect sprays and some medicine for the \nbites spray and Medicine got it make sure to double check your tent before \nyou go and make sure that it's not ripped

terrible mistake lead to \nthe end of a loving friendship let's watch today's video to continue following the love story of Edward Alice \nand [Music] \nan Jack wait up can I ask you for some advice sure what do you need advice \non there is this girl who secretly confessed her feelings to me through a piece of \npaper I don't really know what to do right now talking about girls aren't we well I am \nhappy to inform you that you have asked the right person I'm an expert in love \nrelated matters ha sure man anyway she even \nacted as nothing happened afterward I didn't expect it at all but \nI realized that I am also quite interested in her the moment I saw her \nconfession what should I do first of all she she wrote her confession down on a \npiece of paper yes yes that's right with a delicious homemade lunch as well it was so \ncute H so she must like that kind of thing you know being secretive and all \nwhy don't you do the same to her I don't understand how do I do that \nexactly you are really clu this aren't you let's see you must act \nmysterious for example you can send her a handwritten message yourself surprise her invite her out for \ndinner or ask her to go see a movie with you sing her a song oh buy her roses girls are \ndefinitely into that H that makes sense but do you think that might be too \ncheesy cheesy that is exactly what is going to winner over man you just got to \ndo it h I am not quite sure if that is the case with this one but thank you for \nthe advice I really appreciate it no problem let me know if you need anything \nelse remember I am an expert in this yes I will remember that thank \n[Music] \nyou flowers check I should put it here on this table \nthe camera is set up the card next to the flowers awesome all \ngood I wonder if an would like this ah let's just give it a go dear an roses \nare red violets are blue sugar is sweet and \nso are you my lovely Anne would you be willing to join me tomorrow night to \nhang

talking \nabout yes sure see you then why suddenly someone in this house \nlikes flowers what is this a card oh wow this \nis for me dear an roses are red violets are blue sugar is sweet and so are \nyou my lovely Ann would you be willing to join me tomorrow night to hang out \nI'll will be waiting for you in the living room whenever everyone is asleep there will only be the two of us \nfrom your secret admirer tomorrow night \nhuh ah this is so sweet the poem is really cute too H but who wrote \nthis can it be Jack no way probably not but who else can it be then a \nstranger it must be Jack then oh my God I can't believe this he finally \nchanged his mind I'm so \nhappy hello an hello my lovely little \nsister what made you so happy an you seem really excited today oh yes I am \nvery happy indeed I got a surprise it was so romantic you won't \nbelieve it if I told you then tell me no I want to keep it a \nsecret for now you're so lame I just wanted to be sure first okay \nAlice but I promise I will tell you soon whatever love you by the way how are \nthings going between you and Edward any update an I regret giving him that card \nso much what happened nothing that is the problem he \nis acting like nothing ever happened like he did not read it what if he \ndidn't no I'm sure he did I looked for the note afterward but I couldn't find it \nanywhere well did you ask him about it yes I asked him about lunch he only \nsaid he was really happy with it and nothing else can you believe it h maybe he needs to focus on \nsomething else right now either that or he really doesn't like me \nI guess I just need to accept it don't be so discouraged I think you should tell him \ndirectly it is better that way you can convey your emotions to him and show him that you are really \nsincere maybe that is better than a card you know what if he likes you but does \nnot like the way you confess your feelings no way in hell that is so \nstupid and embarrassing I will
