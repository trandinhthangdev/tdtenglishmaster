talk to her manager let me try to talk to her I \ntried to talk to her but the situation is getting out of hand but what's the \nproblem she wants to return the shirt she bought 3 days ago but she tore the label and has no \nreceipt so handle it according to the rules and refuse her I did but she's \nbeen standing there and complaining for about 20 minutes this is going to affect our \nreputation I think we need to call Mrs Hannah I will call \n[Music] her I thought you said this was going to \nbe easy \nhey how was the stock price we bought last week I'm checking it it's \nfalling really how could it be it's okay don't worry too much stocks go up and \ndown and it's normal but what if I lose all my money well I can't do anything about \nthat I thought you said this was going to be easy nothing is easy actually ESP \nespecially when it comes to money of course oh my money don't worry you should be positive \nand wait for tomorrow okay hope everything goes well

just increased last \nweek I think we might have to walk to work walking for short distances is okay \nbut but for long distances it's not a good idea we have public transportation don't \nwe ah right using public transportation is quite convenient and cheap sure moreover using them is one \nway to save our environment I agree so from tomorrow we can go to work by public transportation \nlike buses okay at least we will do that until the cost of fuel \ndecreases yeah \nthe red \nThe red carpet \ncarpet hey there I've been thinking about trying out a new recipe for tonight's \ndinner it's supposed to be a unique blend of flavors oh that sounds exciting what \nkind of dish is it it's a fusion of Mediterranean and Asian Cuisine \ncombining elements of both cultures but I'm not entirely sure if it will turn out \nwell why not give it a shot it might be a pleasant surprise you're right I'm just worried \nabout getting the balance right well cooking is all about experimenting sometimes you have to \ntrust your instincts and just go for it you're absolutely right I shouldn't be \nafraid to try something new exactly and who knows it might end up being a hit with \neveryone I'm not sure let me try if a turns out great I'll share the recipe with \nyou deal I can't wait to taste your culinary creation good \n[Music] luck we were in the same English \nWe were in the same English class. \nclass Emily oh Alex nice to see you here I was \nquite surprised to meet you here do you like art of course I usually visit the \nart gallery that's great who's this girl she's my little sister do we look \nthe same a little bit Jamie this is Alex we \nwere in the same English class nice to meet you Jamie nice to meet you \ntoo we saw each other quite a long time ago right since we finished the English \ncourse true because we have to go to work and everyone's busy do you still have my phone number \nwe can visit the art gallery together at the weekend that's a great idea let's go \n[Music] together it's so challenging to \nIt's so challenging to discipline kids these days. \ndiscipline kids these [Music] \ndays what's wrong David he looks sad I don't know what to do with my son \nwhat happened last night we had some arguments about his behaviors and \nattitudes oh I see I told him many times not to use the \nphone too much but he kept doing it well it's so challenging to \ndiscipline kids these days that's right and we had many conflicts with each other and I don't \nknow how to resolve them I don't think punishment or yelling at him is a good idea to teach the kids \nwhat should I do children now tend to prefer gentleness and \nsharing you can try to be friends with them to understand their psychology okay I will try to do \nthat I'm quite satisfied with their \nwork your group project is quite good thank you so much we spent lots of \ntime researching And discussing together that's exactly what I want you to do it's group work so you need to \ndiscuss it together how about Anna's group work I see they faced lots of struggles during \nthe process actually I'm quite satisfied with their work that's \ngreat but I think just some of the members did the work why do you think \nso I've read many essays from you and I know the way you write I can see that only Anna and Cindy \nworked not others I got it when will you give us a general \ncomment in the next lesson I'm reading the last one thank you see you next \nweek [Music] \nokay let's practice our \nLet's practice our dance \ndance time flies two days left till our performance at the school \ncompetition I'm so nervous right now why yesterday I saw another team in the \nnext door class practicing and they had a great performance but what do they do in this \ncompetition both sing and dance I thought about this idea but our \nclass doesn't have anyone who can sing well and all members of our class agree to dance in this \ncompetition I want to win this competition in order to win let's \npractice our dance true we are doing well aren't we of course we can do well the next few \ndays to bug [Music] \nTo bug someone \nsomeone I will talk to our next door neighbors I can't stand them anymore what \nhappened don't you see how noisy they are every night I have to go to sleep quite early so I don't hear \nanything I have to go to work late at night and they areir so noisy it's hard to work and go to \nsleep and you need to get up early in the morning that's right they've been bugging me all \nnight so you should ask them to do everything quietly I wonder what they are doing at \nthat time they are young people I think they stay up late I \n[Music] see their plane is going to land \nTheir plane is going to land soon \nsoon what time is it now we've been waiting for Daisy and Alex for an \nhour their plane is going to land soon are you \nsure yeah the airport staff said their flight was delayed for 30 \nminutes oh okay but I'm afraid that we can't come to the restaurant on time \nwhat time did you reserve the table 700 p.m. and now it's 6:30 and \nthey haven't appeared yet just call the restaurant and change the time I think they will assist \nus okay do you think 8:00 p.m. is okay it's okay that should be \nperfect okay I will call them now \ncan we pass by the grocery \nstore Jackson can we pass by the grocery store what do you want to \nbuy I want to buy some ingredients to cook dinner oh will you cook \ntoday yeah it's quite early now it's just 6:00 we will have dinner at 7:30 \np.m. but you worked hard today I think you shouldn't cook let's go to the restaurant and get something to \neat sounds great what do you like to eat up to you but I want to go home and \ntake a shower first sure while you're taking a shower I will find the \nrestaurant that's great I think beef steak is a great idea \n[Music] okay we can sell this old couch \nonline are you going to put this old couch in our new house of course although it's old we can \nstill use it well no way it doesn't match our tone in this living \nroom but I don't want to throw it it's so wasteful we can sell this old couch \nonline could we sure there are a lot of people who need it it still works \nwell sounds good how to sell it just take pictures of it and post them in \nsome groups with your information if someone wants to buy they will contact \nyou okay and we will use the amount of money to buy a new one right it's much \nbetter I got \nit this new development is really interesting [Music] \nThis new development is really interesting \nit's such a long time since I last visited our hometown it changed a \nlot because of the economic increase our hometown was invested in and developed a \nlot there used to be a field here but now it's a park yes there are so many elderly \npeople and children coming here to play and walk every afternoon this new development is really \ninteresting while you weren't here so many things changed right everything is different \nnow but do you like the hometown now or in the past now for sure because there are more \namenities for people I agree with \nyou they can take care of \nThey can take care of themselves \nthemselves dear children stay at home by themselves of course they're not young \nanymore how old are they my son is 16 years old and my \ndaughter is 13 years old aha they're growing up they can take care of \nthemselves right I don't need to be nervous when I'm going out my daughter is still too young my \nwife needs to stay at home and take care of her I understand I used to be like that \nbut can your children cook themselves just some simple dishes I've \nprepared all the ingredients for them oh if they don't have time they can \norder food to eat they prefer that I \nthink that's
