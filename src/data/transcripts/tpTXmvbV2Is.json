remember \nthat's really horrible they've just said on the news that a man died in the fire \noh my god the fire was caused by a faulty gas oven \nso sad to hear that what about the others \nsome people have serious burns some people have minor burns \nbut not life-threatening [Music] \nhometown \n[Music] so john where are you from \ni guess my hometown is not too big it's a little town in the countryside in \nnorthampton there are only 10 000 people there \nso it is very quiet in my hometown i do not really like it \nwow there aren't very many people no it's very small \nis there anywhere to go in your town there aren't very many businesses \nthere isn't a shopping mall there are a lot of grocery stores \nand there are a lot of gas stations but there isn't much to do there \noh really are there any movie theaters well there is one movie theater so \nthat's a nice thing to do is the movie theater good or bad \nin fact there are many screens in this there are eight different movies showing \nhow about at night what do you want to ask about \nwhat's fun to do how about at night is there very much nightlife \nyeah there is not so much but there is a bowling alley it's fun to go bowling \nthere is a bowling alley and a movie theater anything more to do \nthere is one restaurant where you can go for tacos and doritos and there's one more restaurant for \npizza and spaghetti um that must be boring \nbut during the daytime you can go to the park what's inside the park \nthere's a river that goes through the town so in the middle of town there's a river \nand there's a park that goes along both sides of the river and at the park there is a tennis court \nand a disc golf course disca golf \nyeah i like to play disc golf with my friends it's really fun \nand after we finish playing disc golf we usually go to the pizza restaurant \noh i see how about schools are there very many schools \nlet's see no there aren't very many there's only one elementary school one junior high \nschool and one high school that's it interesting \nyeah there aren't very many schools but the town doesn't need more schools because there aren't very many people \nthere i see are there any mountains \nno the whole area is a very flat there are no mountains but there are a \nlot of trees in fact there are trees on my town's sign because my town is famous for all \nthe trees on every street oh wow sounds like a great city \nso harley as i understand you live in croatia where are you from what do you like and \ndislike about your place yes i live in croatia in a city named \npugla where is the city actually it is situated in the israelian \npeninsula and it's the biggest city in istria it counts a population of around sixty \nthousand and do you like it what i like about hula is the fact that \nit's perfectly sized it's not too big nor too small and it has all of the civilization \nbenefits as any western european city that's good though \nfor example in the area of education and culture there is a university a theater \na cinema a great number of galleries museums libraries there are some historical \nsites and so on then for example in the health area there is a hospital a number of private \nclinics dentist offices ambulances and pharmacies and so on \nwhat about places for entertainment there are places to go such as \nrestaurants bars exhibitions concerts especially in the summer during various \nfestivals sports gastronomics musicals dances and theatrical events \nwow that sounds interesting also pula is surrounded by the adriatic \nsea so you can always go to the beach or to one of the many beaches to sunbathe or \ngo fishing or sailing really i really like living near the sea \nif you prefer the land you can take a field trip to the surrounding places and discover their \nnatural and other attractions all together i really love living there \nokay you only told me about your positive sides of living in pula what about your \ndislikes well like any other place there is no perfection \nthe downside is that we have a huge traffic problem i would say especially lately due to some construction projects \nthat sounds uncomfortable so i recommend using public transportation whenever possible or \nsimply going on foot some people might say that pula doesn't exactly have a wild nightlife but i \ndon't consider it a downside rather a peaceful alternative to some other tourist destinations so that's it would \nyou prefer to live somewhere else to be honest i'm not kind of a city \nperson and i am quite fed up with the traffic jam in the city so if i were to live somewhere else it \nwould have to be somewhere off the beaten track to escape the hustle and bustle of city life \nthat way i can be closer to nature and soak up fresh air every morning \nmost people in this world do not live in their home towns why \nwell i guess the majority of people feel that there could be more opportunities outside of their hometowns and \nconsequently comfort zones therefore many believe that living in such a comfortable place with relatives \nand friends can be distracting and too relaxing on the way of pursuing goals \nthey might go abroad as well right yes people not only youth strive to \nexplore other places and experience different cultures across the globe \nwhich affects a person's personality more the hometown of the current city \nwhy hometown defines how a person behaves and the current city defines how a \nperson wants to change i think that the hometown has a much greater impact on a person than the \ncurrent city okay thanks harley \nthank you [Music] \nTalking about your pet \ntalking about your pet becky was walking her dog in the park \nwhen she ran into her old high school friend james they both love dogs and have small talk \nhi james hi do you recognize me it's becky \nwe went to the same high school remember how have you been \noh right i'm okay hi how about you \ni haven't seen you since high school i'm fine how long have you been here \nis your place near here i just moved here last week \ni lived right down the street and you my apartment is across the street \ni'm taking my dog here every day your dog is so cute \nthank you my dog and i want to hang out in this park too \nit's so beautiful wide and has so many dogs to play with \nwhat breed is your dog he is so handsome \nhe's assembloid he is three years old so he's about 35 pounds \nwow his white fur coat is stunning such a big beautiful boy \nwhat's his name it's sam he's a loving dog and highly energetic \nbreed so needs vigorous exercises so i have to walk him two times a day \nhe is so big is he dangerous no samoyads are not at all dangerous or \naggressive in fact he is a natural-born cuddle bug \nbut he can be stubborn sometimes so \nwhat about your little guy here oh his name is pom pom he is a \npomeranian he's only one year old oh interesting palms are known for being \nsmart curious and energetic yes but pomeranians tend to be \nsuspicious around strangers and their small size makes large people \nand animals especially intimidating to them and they can be aggressive so may not be \nthe best choice for families with small kids really \ni didn't know these small guys can cause such problems \nyeah but i had him since he was a newborn and playing with him helps me relax so \nhe is like family to me i know that feeling \ndogs are a great company and very loyal we should go to the park together \ntomorrow yeah sure maybe 5 p.m our dogs can play together \nokay see you then bye see ya \n[Music] john and chuck go to a pet shop to buy a \npuppy for john's daughter thank you chuck for coming here with me \nmy daughter loves puppies so i really want to buy her one for her birthday \nno problem john i'm glad i can help \nhi guys what can i help you with hi i'm looking for a puppy for my little \ndaughter great do you have anything you want in particular \n[Music] um not yet but i think i want one that is friendly \nand not aggressive suitable for small kids we have these golden retriever puppies \nthey are confident smart kind and loyal dogs \nthey are extremely patient which makes them a perfect match for kids [Music] \nyes and they love to play meaning your kid will fall in love instantly \nthat's good do they need any special care well yes they need proper care for their \nglorious golden coats which require twice weekly brushing \num my wife and i are very busy i don't think we have time for that \nwhat about these little guys here these are poodles \nthey are great for kids with allergies as they shed very little \nbut their coat requires scheduled grooming okay \nhow about these oh these newfoundlands are considered to \nbe one of the most intelligent breeds in the world and these dogs just happen to love \nchildren and are very protective of them yes i heard this breed is gentle kind \nand patient almost like the mother teresa of dogs \nyes that's true but they best suit a family with large open spaces \nand they are known to drool and shed excessively so their long coats will also require regular grooming and upkeep \num we live in an apartment so we don't have enough space for large dogs \noh how about a beagle these are small in size and have a calm \ntemperament if your kids love the outdoors this breed will fit right in \noh they're so cute and bright i think your daughter will love it \nyeah i think so too smart friendly and happy the beagle usually gets along with other pets too \ni think this is a perfect choice for my kid in my house \ni would take this chocolate tree puppy is it a female or a male \nwonderful this is a male puppy so he can grow up to 22 and a half pounds \nto 24 and a quarter pounds good do you have any tips for raising \nhim this guy is not picky he eats a lot and you should bring him outside for a walk \nfrequently thank you i will take good care of it \ngreat thank you so much if you have any problems or questions just ask me \nthank you i will bring him home to show him to my daughter right away she would be so \nhappy great bye have a good day you too \n[Music] taylor invites

to have her too \nher loving personality helps me through some really tough times \ni know pets are amazing they are man's best friend \ndo you have a pet yes i have a cat at home \noh really cats are

university life \nTalking about University life \nsituation one nick tells his father joe \nSITUATION 1: Nick tells his father - Joe about his first day of university. \nabout his first day of university [Music] \nhi son how was your first day of university it's good dad \nbut i have to admit that it was quite different from what i had expected \nreally how was it different well i had some strange experiences \ni was baffled to see students playing outdoor and indoor games and enjoying \nradio programs during class hours whoa \nthat's awesome students are free in their movements these days \nyes dad there is no restriction on uniforms people can register their own class \nschedule they can do things according to their choice \nso how is the campus i was very much delighted to see that the grand library of the university \nwhere i could find all the books on every subject and the laboratory is fully equipped i \ncan't wait to perform experiments there wow that's great \nyou kids these days are so lucky with the infrastructure like that \nyou can study so much more effectively so did you make any new friends \nnot yet but i found all the newly admitted students in the high spirits \nthey were all happy to make friends i will attend a meeting for new students \nand hopefully i will have some new friends and what about your new teachers \nmy new teachers are quite different from my high school teachers too they treat us like \nadults because you're all 18 and over you have full responsibilities for your \nactions from now on i know dad i'm so excited to start my university \nlife good luck son i remember my first day at stanford \nit was a sunny and bright day [Music] i woke up early and i spent a lot of \ntime choosing what i wanted to wear i felt excited and at the same time i \nwas very nervous because i don't know anybody and i was lost \nso what did you do i didn't know how to get to my classroom \ni had to ask one person about the building where i was going to take classes \nand luckily he was going to the same class as i was this person was very nice and told me \nthe right direction was that the day you met uncle ted \nyes he is my first and best friend from university [Music] he sat next to me in that class and we \nhad to do a group project together then we became best friends \ni think that it is natural that on the first day we feel nervous but things always have a happy ending \ni'm always going to remember that day because i had the opportunity to meet more people \nand most importantly i met the best friends that i have ever had don't worry son you will meet the best \nfriends at university thanks dad [Music] \nSITUATION 2: Mike is a freshman, he meets Jacob - a junior and asks for his advice about university life. \nsituation two mike is a freshman he meets jacob a junior and asks for his \nadvice about university life [Music] \nhey are you new here i'm mike i'm a freshman \nno i'm a junior i'm jacob nice to meet you oh i'm sorry i didn't know \nwhere do you come from jacob i'm from miami how about you \ni'm from l.a what is your major studying computer science \nwow that's cool my major is english literature \none of the biggest reasons why i chose that is that i want to be a writer \noh wow i hope i can work as a computer engineer after i graduate \ni'm so nervous about the next semester i'm afraid of failing \ni have test anxiety how about you believe me i still have concerns too but \ndon't worry do you want some advice sure thank you \nwhat was your biggest fear before you began your freshman year of university \ni worried that schoolwork would be too hard i wouldn't be able to keep up or i \nwouldn't know the correct answer when called on in class but everyone makes mistakes don't worry \nbut what should i do if i fall behind in my classes if deadlines are fast approaching and \nyou're behind on your work you should structure your time take notes \ndo extra homework ask your friends things that you don't understand \nthanks you make me feel so much better but how do i make the most effective \nnotes before you even think about heading to class make sure that you've read all the \npre-assigned reading from your professor go to class with a positive attitude and \npay attention experiment with different taking notes techniques to find one that's right for \nyou [Music] should i take part in a club or student organization \npersonally i think taking part in one can be a rich and rewarding experience \nyou can find new friends that likely share the same interests are you a member of any student \norganization and what clubs should i participate in \ni'm the english book club and i think there are many student clubs and organizations for different \nmajors and departments such clubs can be a lot of fun as well as a great academic resource for you \ngreat can i ask you a personal question what's your biggest motivation for your \nuniversity life because i know that on average a student with a university education will make \nmore money throughout his or her lifetime than a student without one but it's not easy to stay motivated in \nschool what should i do if i lose interest in studying \nyou should design a life plan and commit to your dreams think about it if your life was as good \nas it could be what would it look like design a road map keep this map in mind \nthank you one final question what's the best advice you would tell a \nfriend who is now entering university set high personal and academic standards \nfor yourself believe in yourself realize that school is work it's not \nplaytime settle for nothing less than your very best \nthank you for your advice i think i'm ready to start my university life \nwishing you lots of success as you begin your new journey you can always talk to me \ntext me if you need help sure see you later \nbye [Music] \nthanks for watching don't forget to like share comment on my video
