you still at home right \nnow today I'm off I'm free today well great so today I'll be taken to school \nby you you look so happy \nyou can't trust him topic English is easy don't eat too \ndo you remember Alex Alex why do you mention him \nyesterday he texted me about borrowing some money how much \n$200 you didn't lend it to him did you I did I think he's having a hard time so I \nagreed to lend it to him oh God you can't trust him why he's my \nfriend but you don't know much about him how can you easily lend him money well I \njust think he had no choice but to text me like that he has a bad reputation for \nborrowing money and not paying it back really I never knew that you trust \npeople too easily [Music] \nthe result will make you [Music] \nhappy hey do you want to make pottery of course that sounds fun it's \nreally fun you know how to make pottery yesterday I went to a workshop \nabout pottery and I tried to make it sounds great I found it really interesting this is a \nvase that I made myself under the guidance of the instructor wow you're so good but I'm \nafraid that I can't do it don't worry there are tutors there and someone to guide you step by \nstep really yeah do you want to go I have the link to register \nhere yes I want to go it's easy I'm sure the result will make you happy I hope \n[Music] so how much do I have to \n[Music] pay hi I'd like to book a room for three \nnights certainly we have a few different options available what kind of room are you \ninterested in just a standard room would be fine okay \nour standard rooms are priced at $150 per night so for three nights it \nwould come out to $450 oh that's a bit more than I was \nexpecting are there any other options that are a bit more affordable we do have a smaller room \navailable for $100 per night it's not as spacious but it might be more in line \nwith your budget I think I'll go with that one how much do I have to pay up \nfront you'll need to pay for the first night in advance which comes out to \n$100 and then will charge your credit card for the remaining two nights when you check out sounds good can I pay with \nmy debit card of course let me just process the payment for the first night \nhere's my card and there you go all set thank you \nso much \njump in with both [Music] \nfeet why do you always argue with Jessica she always annoys me I can't \nstand her anymore ah well as I see it you are too \nfastidious Anna I think you shouldn't jump in with both feet do you know what \nshe did to me what did she do she took my workbook and copied it without my \nconsent after I confronted her she denied it so we argued I didn't know that when you came \nI was talking loud so you just thought I was the one who started it I'm \nsorry it's okay don't worry I just wanted to ask and reconcile the two of \nyou thank you but it's okay now she will never act like that anymore I believe it \nI think I can do it [Music] \nmyself are you all clear about the tasks we have to do sure quite a lot but I \nhope we can do it well hey do you think the video should be worked on by two \npeople what do you think Julia do you feel it's too too hard to do alone well I think I can do it \nmyself are you sure the video will be about 10 minutes it will take you a \nweek really I don't think it takes that long well I made a 3 minute video before \nand I had to spend nearly 3 days doing it I'm afraid you can't do it \nalone so can anyone help me with the video I have experience I can help you \nthat's great so Hannah will support Julia okay \nsure come take a walk with \nme why are you off today I'm not in the mood to go to work what's \nwrong nothing just some problems with with my boyfriend oh how about love but you \ndon't look good these days I think you have some health problems maybe I usually have a headache I'm \nunder a lot of pressure well take a rest girl I want to \ngo out come and take a walk with me but I'm at the office now how about after \nwork that's fine anytime okay so after work I'll come to \nyour house and we take a walk sure see you \n[Music] then her blood pressure has gotten \nreally [Music] low what's wrong I don't know she's \nnearly fainting let me see what's wrong with her her blood \npressure has gotten really low why why I guess she skipped her breakfast so she \nhas no energy ah I got it because we've walked a lot and she hasn't eaten \nanything I think so does anyone have candy or something sweet for what eating \nsweets when blood pressure is low will help oh really I didn't know that I have \nsome candies here \ngood we can win this match if we work \n[Music] \ntogether do you know there is a bad mitton competition at our school next week yeah I know but there are only \ncategories of manwoman pairs exactly so I have an idea what's \nthat I know you're really good at badminton I'm also on it how about playing together do you mean we will \nregister and play as a pair right we can win this match if we work together \nsounds great I agree yeah so let's practice a bit to get acquainted sure the match is on \nFriday right yes we have a week to practice I believe we can win hope

laughed well they quarreled and had a little stule and some teach \ngame yeah I left when Mr David was coming yes that he was able to stop them \nand then then they apologized to each other in front

the new guy in the office yet yeah I bumped into him at the \ncoffee machine what's he like seems cool quiet maybe but it was \njust a quick hello what else do you know about him not much just that he moved here \nfrom out west out west like California I think so he mentioned \nsurfing during the intro interesting did he say why you \nmoved not really just something about a fresh start \nsounds mysterious maybe a little he seems to keep to himself have you worked with him yet no \nbut I've seen him around the office I wonder what he's working on not \nsure he's in a different department isn't he yeah he's with the design team \nI think you're curious about him huh just trying to get to know the people I \nwork with fair enough I guess will find out more at the team \nlunch yeah I'll

I'm a quick \nlearner we'll see about that good luck Jake thanks Emily I might need it \n[Music] cloth \n[Music] \nmaterials do you know anything about cloth materials just the basics why I'm trying \nto pick a fabric for my new dress what clothing options do you have \nsilk cotton and polyester silk is fancy isn't \nit yes but it's also delicate and hard to maintain how about \ncotton it's comfy but it wrinkles easily and \npolyester it's durable but not as breathable sounds like a tough \nchoice I want something that looks good and feels good maybe a BL like cotton \nsilk that could work it's soft and less wrinkly but will it \nlast not as long as polyester for sure you might have to compromise \nsomewhere I guess so maybe I'll get two dresses instead that's the spirit double the \nfun and Double the Trouble deciding you'll figure it out you always \ndo thanks for the vote of confidence anytime let's go fabric \nshopping oh you're coming with of course I need to see this epic decision making \nin action well let's hope it's epic in a good way it sure \n[Music] is buying sheets and \nbedding [Music] \nI can't believe how many options there are I know right choosing sheets should \nbe simple what's the difference between Egyptian cotton and regular \ncotton I think Egyptian cotton is supposed to be softer but there's like a $200 \ndifference is it really that much better maybe it's one of those luxury \nthings luxury or not I just want something that feels \nnice what about thread count they say the higher the better do you really believe that I \ncan't even tell the difference not sure but let's check out these 800 thread count \nones they do feel pretty nice but look at this pattern that's \ncolorful very loud too much for me \nI prefer something more subtle here's a nice one simple High thread counts and \nsoft and it's on sale that's my favorite feature it's like it was made for you \ndon't jinx it let's grab it before someone else does do we need matching \npillowcases might as well it's all about the aesthetic right we're going to have \nthe best dressed bed in town as long as it's it's comfortable I'm \nhappy comfortable and stylish
