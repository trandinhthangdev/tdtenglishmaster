watch the video and see a funny story of a group of four when they \nstarted investing in stocks \n[Music] \nhey guys what are you doing just received the electricity bill this month josh we are splitting the bill \nreally how much is it here is the bill check it yourself \nlet me see oh my gosh no doubt why all your faces are pale \nright why is the bill so high [Music] electricity price raised again haven't \nyou watched the news raised again what is happening everything raises these days \nwhat are you doing samantha i'm doing life budgeting again i think it's time for me to ask for a \npay raise okay i was going to make money alone but seeing everyone struggling like that i \ncouldn't stand it therefore if you have money let's invest in stocks \ninvest in stocks why i have an acquaintance who is a stock analyst \nhe said he had known a very good company what company \ni heard that company specializes in providing some sort of ai technology it \nis predicted to grow very strongly if we buy its stocks now it will be \nprofitable later if there is a profit how much will it be about 10 times \nplease be a little bit more specific more specifically i'm not sure everyone here has no idea \nabout stocks no matter how much i explain you won't understand who told you we don't know about stocks \n[Music] do you know anything about stocks brian i know a little bit \nbuy low and sell high but is it not obvious \nsure it's best to do that but it is advised not to be too ambitious \nso just keep buying at a certain low point and selling when it is higher is enough \nright that's right my father said this to me we shouldn't hold stocks of companies that are going \ndownhill why is that because if you keep engrossed with a \ncompany that is falling one day that company really goes bankrupt you will have nothing left \nthat's right i heard that some people invested too much then lost and went crazy \ni also heard another similar sentence comfort is better than pride solidity \nfirst i see that everyone knows a bit about stock too so if you want to invest tell me \nhey josh i want to invest here's what i've got help me buy low and sell high okay \nremember josh i want to invest but are you sure that the company won't \ngo downhill my mantra is comfort is better than pride solidity first \nplease help me invest at the lowest risk \nday one [Music] \ni didn't understand anything looking at it does it increase yes \nyou already made an extra one thousand dollars congratulations one thousand dollars a day huh \nlucky you i would have borrowed more to invest and earn more if it keeps growing like that we're \ngoing to be rich right hey it increased a lot today do you \nthink it won't drop tomorrow is it possible that the company will go downhill tomorrow \ni'm not sure either but at least it's growing from now on see really will continue to increase \ni don't have ambition i just want solidity first so when it's reasonable help me sell it \nokay and for me just help me buy low and sell high don't forget \nand me i want to earn a lot of money please help me to make it 10 times more \n[Music] day two \n[Music] hey what's up \nwhy are you still awake josh it decreased what degrees \nthe stock i told you yesterday was gonna decline ah \nwait for a few more days and see what if it drops again should we sell it now \njust wait a few more days but i don't have that money clean ambition i just want certainty \nokay i will sell it tomorrow okay how about the other two \nno they still keep it really oh maybe i will keep it for a few more days \nthen [Music] \nday three josh the stock price decreased again \nit has dropped for two days straight yeah we should do something \ncan you have a little patience it's normal to have its ups and downs but it has been down for two days in a \nrow this company is running downhill we should sell the stock now \nthe company is still developing two days is nothing i told you just buy low and sell high \nhow simple is it huh you all are so paranoid that's all \nprincipal [Music] \nday four josh josh what's up \nthe stock price decreased again come on be a bit more patient there's no big \nloss yet you asked me to wait every day but i told you i just need certainty \ni don't want to be risky okay okay i will sell it out for you \nhow about the other two have they sold yet nope not yet \nokay then talk to you later [Music] \noh no it declined again brian oh my gosh \nwhat am i gonna do now [Music] what's wrong \nbro don't you notice the stock price declined again yeah i know \njust wait a little bit more wait for what for it to decrease even \nmore why do we hold stocks from a company that is going downhill again i told you several times \nthat we have to buy low sell high is that difficult for you \nwhat's up everyone you're so noisy you know what the price continued to \ndecrease no sell it right now for me josh i said i want money but it has to be no risk \noh you guys are so annoying keep repeating those nonsenses \nwhat are you talking about we should be the ones who get mad at you because of this loss \nokay fine i will send back to you the exact number that you gave me okay \nwill you sell the stocks as well no actually i will hold yours i hope you \nwon't regret it weeks later \nbrain lucy and samantha are investing stocks in their own ways but the result \nis lucy who is always afraid of investing in companies that are doing bad \neventually invested in a company that's seriously running downhill because she \ndoesn't even know how to read a business report brian who strictly follows the buy low \nsell high principle actually turned out to buy high sell low because of his panic \nand samantha who always mentions solidity first turns out to have the most uncertain \ninvestment with her random portfolio and me who tried to hold the three \nstocks have gained 300 profit on the investment \n[Music] life then now \nsamuel and thomas they are discussing the changes in their \nlife i suppose one of the biggest turning points in my life \nwas when i moved from our hometown to the capital city what happened at that time \ni was 14 years old when i migrated i had to leave my school \nfriends relatives known places and start living in a place where i had \nno friends no one to visit and no known place for playing or outing \nthat should be a frustrating experience for you but i made new friends very quickly and \nmy teachers were very helpful as well but one problem is that i could not \nsecure even a top 10 position in my new school while i was a top scorer in my \nprevious school i know that you used to be a smart kid \nyes so i started studying harder visit a library more and read a reference book \nmore than once do you think it was good for you \nnow i think it was really good i shrink my time playing games and took part in football \n[Music] well those changes helped you study more learn more and remain healthy \nyeah i found that some of the health-related problems that i used to have are no longer bothering me \nalso i'm so glad that i started reading books as it gave a certain kind of \nconfidence boost by teaching me a lot of unknown and amazing things about this world \nfor me i think i am not healthier than i was about 10 years ago \nwhy do you think so lately i have been so busy that i have \nnot been taking enough time to exercise or cook healthy food \ndo you think you will have a healthy diet soon i am having a plan for it \ni'm going to clean out my fridge all of my favorite unhealthy foods and begin \ncooking homemade meals i think i will also drink two liters of \nwater a day instead of soft drinks to lose weight i registered at my local \ngym and started to work out at least three times a week i felt stronger and happier than ever \nbefore i rarely got sick and my skin also looked brighter \ni can see that on your face i think i regained my self-confidence \ni am now much more comfortable being photographed when i was a teenager i mainly subsisted \non fast foods such as fried chicken hamburgers or crisps \noh i put on weight rapidly so i think now is the time to start my weight loss journey \nor i will become overweight that's true we are older we should be \nhealthier right okay what about stress are you more stressed \nnow than you were three years ago that's a hard question i'm probably about the same \nso i wouldn't say that i'm more stressed now but three years ago i was finishing my \nbachelor's degree so that was also a stressful time and lately i've been quite busy with my \nwork so i'm probably at the same stress level as three years ago \ni think i'm now not as stressed as i was in the past actually because i worry less \nso before i was more stressed because i worried about everything and now i've learned to let it go \nlet things go i don't let them bother me so how do you usually reduce stress \nactually there are many things that can make me happy hanging out with friends and having some \ncoffee or being given a small gift helps me let off some steam or just the feeling of trying a good \ndish brings me happiness to me participating in an outdoor of sport \nsuch as basketball is a great way to cope with stress it refreshes my mind and cheers me up a \nlot besides cooking delicious dishes for the family also helps me feel relaxed after \nstressful hours at my workplace perhaps now we have more stress because \nof the heavy workload and related responsibilities at the workplace \nsome people may have to face problems related to the financial burdens in which they may not have enough money \nto pay for their increasing house rent there's a lot more to think about in the \nfuture we are older now so we are more worried about money \nbut maybe in the next 10 years job security things like that so sadly i'm a \nlittle more worried about that right everything will be fine \nhow about you are you more worried about your future these days i'm quite sure i have a good job and i \nlike the place i live so i don't feel too worried about what i will be doing next year or even seven \nyears but we should probably plan ahead a bit more \nbut anyway what comes will come well this is a healthy attitude to have \nare there any changes in our town i think it developed \nsignificantly in the last 10 years did it become industrialized \nyes it did i think industrialization is beneficial to our residents and to the local \neconomy since jobs have been generated but it also brings so much pollution \ni think we are paying the price now for converting our agricultural lands to industrial \nthe living cost is now undeniably high too noise pollution is incredible \nyou know now i am getting used to the crowd and noise in the city [Music] so basically our city has progressed but \nthere are still underlying issues that need to be improved anyway i think we are happier now than \nwe were previously definitely we don't have to think about studying at school anymore \nyes and we are happy with our jobs families and friends and i have more free time now so i can \nspend more time on entertainment too congratulations \nyou must help with the stress level as well yes i think i'm having a balanced life \n[Music] \ntopic george had just learned painting from a good teacher and he wants to share his \nartwork with his staff at the office let's see what happens and learn how to use exclamation sentences together \n[Music] \ngood morning everyone good morning boss good morning george \nhello

finish this artwork like more than half an hour \nwow so amazing in such a short time \nyes i'm not sure if it's good but i like it of course this painting is excellent \nlook this paint streak is so delicate yes it has created a highlight for the \nwhole picture making the picture suddenly become very profound \nbut but it's just a streak of paint that's left when i tried to clean the paint off

encourage me that way i know i'm still not good enough \nno you're not lying i know you all just want to motivate me \nboss don't you believe us come on a random brushstroke created a \nhighlight for

people i have other people i have my sister and my mom and my dad \nand my friends but valentine's day is more of a holiday for people that have a boyfriend or a \ngirlfriend or a wife or a husband or children as \nopposed to being a single person with nobody to share it with \nbut could you share it with your sister or your mother or your father \ni could i could and we do we send each other gifts \nwe well this year i won't be with anybody \nbut i get to celebrate it with my sister this weekend \nwell that sounds fun it is so \nwhat kinds of things have you done on valentine's day in the past \num gone out for dinner gone to a movie had dinner at my parents house \nhad dinner at my grandparents house that's interesting why your grandparents \nhouse it was their wedding anniversary \nwow that's a great day to have a wedding anniversary \nit is and it was a lot of fun i got to spend time with their \nlast few years together having dinner with them that sounds lovely \nso are you looking forward to maybe having a valentine next year \nmaybe we'll see [Music] \nmel and doran discuss various valentine's experiences \nso doran what did you do last valentine's day \nlast valentine's day i got disappointed i think \nbecause i teach at university and i hear that japanese students always \ngive their teachers loads and loads of chocolate and even though it was my fifth year and \nevery other year i only got like two or three i was really excited because i'm at a \nuniversity now and i got two chocolate bars oh really \noh about you are you looking forward to it this year i'm planning on going to korea with my \nco-workers to escape valentine's day to escape \nthe atmosphere yes you're not a fan then \ni like valentine's day but i don't plan on celebrating it this year \nis valentine's day big in england i haven't lived in england for a while \nnow about 10 years when i was a kid it was a big deal in \nschool like in junior school and we used to have a little valentine's \npost box in our class when we could write little messages to our classmates and \nthen you put it in the box and it get delivered oh in a box \nyeah in a little valentine's post box oh \ncool the teacher would deliver them did you only get notes or did you get \ncandy as well no it was just notes \nin england we don't really give candy and chocolate and presents to people \nwe just give letters unless it's like a boyfriend or a girlfriend or something \nbut when i am seven i don't really bother well \nthe thing i liked about valentine's day as a kid was that you'd get valentine's day cards from everyone \nbut i was always curious to see what the boy i liked wrote to me \ndo you know who yeah \nthey would sign their name on the card what they signed names \nyeah it'd be like happy valentine's day oh \nin england i don't think you put your name even if you know who it's from you know \nit's from your girlfriend or your best friend or your grandma or something i think you just put a big question mark \nreally it's half the fun you have to figure it out but my favorite valentine's day gift is \nalways from my mom she gives you a gift every year \nshe'll send me gifts in the mail \nand when i was in elementary school she would hide chocolates and stuff in my desk it was awesome \n[Music] that's brilliant \nyeah i don't remember getting any really really cool valentine's presents \ni remember giving a couple i was dating a girl who lived in norway when i was at \nuniversity in england and so for valentine's day is the same \ni think her birthday was february the 11th or something \noh yeah so i just flew over i emailed her best \nfriend who i knew quite well as well and he picked me up at the airport and flew over to norway \nyeah and in norway it's a very safe country \nso they don't really lock their doors a bit like japan \nand he just drove me down to the house and i walked in at like nine in the morning \nand she just came downstairs and she nearly died she thought i was a ghost \nyeah that would be scary but fun scary but fun \nthat's what she said when she could talk yeah so it was a double birthday valentine's \nday gift exactly [Music] \ncomfort and encouragement what do we need when we have some \ntroubles this is comfort and encouragement \nwatch the video and learn the ways we can say encouragement \nlost wallet [Music] \nyou look so nervous alice what's wrong with you \ncan i help you jenny i don't know what i should do now \ni don't know i just want to cry [Music] \ncalm down tell me what's the problem \nthis morning when i went to the market i put my phone and wallet in my bag \ni definitely remember that but when i bought food and was about to \npay i couldn't find them [Music] \n[Applause] both your wallet and phone \nyes i lost them i must have forgotten to unzip the bag \nwhat should i do now jenny \nwhat's in your wallet i don't remember i'm so nervous now \nokay i know but you have to

bank card \nand which store did you go to to buy food i've done that \nthis store is near my house the important thing now is that you \ndon't cry crying won't solve anything \nokay should i call the police now \ni think first you should go to that store and report the incident \nand ask them to check the camera do you think this shop has cameras \nno all stores have cameras to avoid some situations like yours \nif you got stolen there you'll find the culprit soon \njenny thank you i'm gonna go now \ndon't worry too much everything will be resolved if anything \nhappens give me a call thanks \n[Music] \ndon't make the same mistake again [Music] \n[Applause] [Music] \nwhat happens to you i see you are sad since talking to the \nmanager what's wrong [Applause] \nyeah nothing do you remember the product presentation \nthis morning yes i do after this \ni saw our boss was very angry yes \nthat's all my mistake i forgot to check the documents that had \nto be sent to the partner \nand then what happened today they have no documents \nthe manager just scolded me for that carelessness partners complained a lot \n[Music] ah \ni understand but don't worry much everything will be fine \ni know but i can't believe i made such a silly mistake like this \ndon't blame yourself anymore jack i should have double checked everything \nthe manager trusted me so much and i let him \ncome on jack don't be too sad this is just an error \nhow stupid am i it's also a lesson for you \ndon't make such unnecessary mistakes again \nyeah i didn't do it on purpose but surely the manager was very angry \nand disappointed you're a hard-working person \njust try to do the following things carefully you will get his trust back \n[Music] i've always been confident that i'm \ncareful at work but don't say that \nno one is perfect do you know yes \ni know everyone makes mistakes sometimes \nyou just have to try not to make that mistake again and show that you can do more \nyes now

you're eating but how do that sarah i'm too busy \nmaybe you should find a new roommate she'll help you prepare the meal \nor you can talk to your boss and ask him to allow you to go home early to prepare a meal \nyou can continue to work after eating \ngreat idea sarah i'll talk to my boss first good luna i believe you'll enjoy eating \nthe food you make yourself you can also find new dishes

you choose the drink that fits your taste \nso i'll meet you there at 8pm is that fine sure see you then bye \nlater \n[Music] hey maria over here \nhi girls what can i help you with today hi i don't know what to order can you \nhelp me with the menu sure here \ni highly recommend this drink whiskey sour it's a bourbon-based cocktail a \ncombination of whiskey sugar and lemon juice it's my all-time favorite \ni want something fresher how about a mojito \nthis classic cuban cocktail features a combination of citrus sweet and mint flavors to control the strong taste of \nrum but i think it especially is enjoyable on a hot summer day at the pool \nmaria how about long island iced tea you like iced tea right \nfor those who love iced tea this long island-based drink is even better \nit may look like a regular glass of tea but a mixture of vodka rum tequila gin \ntriple sec and cola can give it a strong taste or you can try lemon drop \nit is the perfect combination of sweet and sour garnished with a fun and colorful lemon \ntwist and sugar around the rim of the glass for extra sweetness it's my favorite drink \nthey both sound tasty but i want to see other options \nwhat does this bloody mary taste like this popular and complex beverage can be \nas spicy or mild as you like flavorings such as tabasco sauce \nworcestershire sauce and cayenne pepper pepper can be added according to your preferred taste \nthat's interesting i think i will try the spicy bloody mary please \ngreat choice you will love it this is fun right we should do this more \noften sure i'll try to other drinks next time \n[Music] \nunconsciously manipulating [Music] \nlucy what's wrong it just set an argument with layla \n[Music] really for what \nit's a long story but basically it's about her on off relationship with dan \n[Music] oh cheer up there two will make peace soon i know \nbut elena do you think i'm in a manipulator why \nleila said i was a puppet master always wanting others to follow what i say \nno not that bad you may just unconsciously want to manipulate \nunconsciously yes it can be a bad habit that you don't even realize \nbut do i really do that okay so do you often get involved in others \nrelationships or influence their decisions yes but i just give them advice they \ncome to me don't they [Music] \nsure but if they don't listen to you will you get mad \nyeah so are you mad at layla for some reason \nyeah you're right you see this habit can badly affect relationships \nyeah but she came to me every single time they broke up should i not give her advice \nyes she might just need someone to share when she gets emotional not to be told what to do \nhmm i've never thought of that way let people manage their own lives and if \nthey fail let them fail on their own what if they ask for advice \nof course feel free to express your opinion but don't get mad if they don't follow your advice \nthanks mia i will try to get rid of this habit \n[Music] \nemotional explosion [Music] \nemma you look so sad what happens i just had a fight with my boyfriend \ndid he say something hurtful no \nactually me who did that really yeah \ni was angry then i said some really bad things to him it's okay \ni think he won't hold it against you i know but i feel disappointed in myself \nare you regretting it now yeah i'm such hot tempered i shouldn't \nsay those things the thing is do you want to change \nyes i think i may have had this habit for too long it's so easy to lose control \n[Music] don't let your anger get the best of you and regret it later \nwhat should i do now firstly you should make peace with him \ni will secondly next time something sets you off \nkeep your mouth shut before you say anything that's very difficult \njust leave the room take three deep breaths and think about what you're feeling \nso going away first yeah think about the best way to handle the situation \nthat's so mature of you to talk about things like this i'm just talking from personal \nexperience been there done that \nreally did you have an emotional explosion too yes i heard many relationships because of \nthat bad habit then i decided to change i didn't know that \nin my mind you're always a very calm person well practice makes perfect try the things i \ntold you yes i will thanks a lot for the advice \n[Music] \ndelay taking action \n[Music] \nlily what are you doing oh nothing much i'm looking at my goal \nlists oh the one you made at the end of the year yes \nhow much have you achieved until now it may be ridiculous but \nnothing what seriously \nyeah but why i don't know i still look at the list \nevery day and dream about the day when i achieved them \noh so you mean you're just thinking about the success but not doing anything \nyeah now when you mention it i realized it's true though many people make this mistake too \nhaving big dreams but they never step toward their ambitions but you know sometimes i feel like there \nare so many things to do i don't even know where to start [Music] \nthat's why you need an action plan and follow it not just saying i have a dream \naction plan yes the important thing is that you need a \ndetailed action plan with deadlines why deadlines \nyou won't be able to accomplish anything without deadlines you're right \nuntil now i just keep thinking about what if i succeed but not about doing the thing \nyou know what the hardest part is the beginning it takes a lot of courage to start \n[Applause] [Music] but what if you are demotivated \nremember this only when you take action you will get closer to success \nyes so it's about action and not about motivation at all \nno need for motivation inspiration it's good if you have but if not say to \nyourself just do it thanks a lot for those wide words jane \n[Music] \nmaterial happiness [Music] \nhey what are you thinking about tony you look so lost uh nothing are you happy with your life \nnow why so suddenly of course i am \ni'm just thinking about happiness though what's wrong \nyou know i had nothing all i tried was to work harder and harder and to get closer to \nsuccess [Music] yes you did work so hard \nnow when i had somehow achieved a bit i still don't feel happy \nhmm i think you are seeking the meaning of life aren't you yeah kind of \ni was happy when i bought my first house my first car \n[Music] but then no feeling anymore \nsure what gives your life meaning it's not the car the house money \nbut the people that love you the experiences you gain and the passions that expire you \nyeah i kind of regretted focusing too much on material things before \nwhat did you think before before i just focused on making money expanding my source of income things \nlike that were you happy back then to be honest \ni don't know i spent the whole time working and trying to reach success \ni think you should discover meaning elsewhere elsewhere \ni mean not only from material things or money but from the smallest things around you \nsuch as from your relationships or diving deeper into your interests \nyeah i should learn how to be happy again happiness is within you tony \nit's not hard to find happiness as you think thanks peter \n[Music] a health problem \nabdul and sally are talking about their illness experience and their ways to \nkeep themselves healthy so what is the most serious illness you \nhave ever experienced in your life i would like to talk about a car \naccident that happened to me a few years ago and resulted in serious injury injuries \noh really how was it it was a horrible experience that i \nwould not want to relive oh dear tell me what happened please \nmy family was driving home when a big truck crashed into our passenger side \nafter the accident i blacked out and was transported to the hospital \nwhen i regained consciousness i discovered that i had five broken bones several ruptures \nand many cuts and bruises did you have any treatments after that \nto restore the collarbone and leg bone i had to go through operations during \nwhich metal rods were put onto these bones to fix them \nnot surprisingly i was in severe pain so physicians prescribed me to take \npainkillers and other medicines for a couple of weeks \nhow long did it take you to recover during my recovery i wasn't able to walk \nproperly and my life then was very difficult but after several months of proper \ntreatment and physical therapy i fully recovered does your life change a lot after \ni even took up karate soon after although the illness was definitely not \na pleasant experience i am very happy and grateful that now i am healthy \nprobably i learned to value health and become stronger wow luckily you are healthy now \nyes i think so as well what about you did you experience a lot of illness \nwell i guess i will tell you about one memorable experience it happened a few months ago when i had of the flu coupled \nwith a sore throat what happened \na week before it happened i was so stressed with work i had stayed up \nthe night in the office to meet several deadlines \na lack of sleep and i couldn't also eat on time oh you must have been really tired \nmy body started to feel weak i started to have slight fever and colds \ni knew it was going to be bad because i was having headaches and severe muscle and body aches \ni also started to have a dry cough and my throat hurt did you go see the doctor \nit lasted for about a week i went to see a doctor so i could get the right prescription \ni was advised to have bed rest for a few days i was not able to report to work for a \nweek luckily i have already finished all of my deadlines before it happened \nbut it had still affected my life because i had failed to do my daily routine i also asked my mom to take care of me \nsince i lived alone when i went back to work there was a \nhuge pile of paperwork waiting on my desk \nhow was the health care system in your country costa rica is actually a pretty healthy \ncountry we have one of the only five blue zones in the world \nwhich are these areas where because of their lifestyle population frequently reaches a hundred years or more \nis that one good signal about your country but unsurprisingly one of the major \nhealth problems that we face is obesity because our modern lives are so frequently making us sedentary and \nworking in office spaces and in enclosed rooms especially under the current conditions \nwe tend to become overweight that's true \nkeeping a healthy lifestyle is not a priority for a lot of people especially because they have very busy \nroutines you know that being said it is important to keep a healthy lifestyle and it's one \nof those problems that the entire world seems to be facing at the moment i don't belong to a gym \nbut i go jogging usually i go jogging four times a week \nand i also go in the morning because for me it's the best time to exercise because it keeps me awake all day but at \nthe moment i don't do any other exercise \nwow just the running just the running \nso what do you do to keep fit many things but i think discipline is \none of the most important things you need to be a disciplined person \nis it hard to become a disciplined person a little bit disciplined person \nbut saying that it's not hard to be disciplined because you do things that you like to do for example \ni do yoga and i enjoy yoga so every day i get up in the morning and i do an hour \nof yoga and this is very good for your body well so basically one of the pillars of your \nway of staying healthy is to have the discipline to exercise regularly \nbut it doesn't have to be strenuous just little things a little bit of exercise every day \nsomething simple something easy something you like to do whether it's walking or whether it's \nriding your bicycle to work instead of taking the subway or yeah doing some yoga \ni guess you are a sporty person is that right not really just a little bit of exercise \na few days a week and it will help you stay fit and healthy do you have a healthy diet \nreasonably healthy i'm semi-vegetarian so i don't eat meat i only eat fish and \ni eat lots of fruits and vegetables have you ever eaten fast food \nwell i also like my junk food and usually once a day i eat either potato chips or cake \nso yeah i have a balanced diet what kind of fruits do you like to eat \nwell i like all fruits i love all fruits except pineapple i hate pineapple i don't know why \ni just don't like pineapple i don't like the taste i don't like to chew it it just feels funny \nbut i love apples i love bananas i love oranges i usually have an apple every morning \nfor breakfast it's very easy to eat and i just love apples because you can \ntake them to school you can eat them quickly they're very easy to eat \nme too i also like oranges and i love orange juice so sometimes i \nmake fresh orange juice in my kitchen and i love to eat bananas and \nstrawberries together so my favorite snack is to cut up some bananas and then cut up some \nstrawberries and mix them together and then eat them well it sounds like you really \ndo like

style with kind of white plain walls a darker color tone \nfor furniture and a lot of glasses and marble flooring \n[Music] to be honest it looks great i love simplicity however we plan to have a \nbaby in the near future so do you think we should try something a little bit softer \nyou are right how about this traditional style with a \nneutral color tone with floral patterns looks a bit old-fashioned to me \nyou like this style don't you um not really i just like the cozy feeling \nso do i i prefer something that makes me feel at home any other options that are both modern \nand cozy yes this one what do you think it still looks simple \nand modern but a lot cozier with a warmer color light gray or brownie is trending this \nyear i like this one especially the wooden flooring \nwe

into brown or beige colors like this one me too in short our taste is modern \nbut cozy neutral brown beige tone then i think wooden furniture will be an \nexcellent match sure i will note it down we

my teeth having breakfast at home \nand going to work at 8am yeah a typical morning right \nyes simple one you prefer to have breakfast at home don't you \nyes but sometimes when i'm in a hurry i will buy breakfast on the way to work \nyeah and then work finishes at 5 pm i leave work and go to the supermarket \nto buy food for dinner wow then cook wash dishes have a shower \ndoes it eat up all your free time in the evening no actually my free time is from 8 to 10 30 \npm what do you do during those 2 hours and a half it depends on my mood but normally i \nwatch movies and listen to music and not normal \ni learned something new wow you deserve respect \nwhy not for example learn how to sing draw \nlots of different interesting things to learn [Music] \nyou're right but to be honest whenever someone mentions learning or studying i feel tired \nyeah i can imagine do you go to sleep at 10 30 pm \nyes but like 15 minutes before sleep time i usually read a book [Music] \nhow do you feel about that life routine sometimes i feel a bit boring but i'm \nalso feeling thankful because i still have time for myself you're right \nenjoy this precious time you may not have much free time when you get married and have kids \noh man that future is still too far for me [Music] \ni know i just mean enjoy the moment thanks \n[Music] \nwhat do you do when you have too much free time [Music] \nhi i'm hannah thank you for coming to our podcast today hi hannah it's so nice to be here today \nbefore we start our podcast i want to introduce our guest today skyler howell \nskyler can you introduce a bit about yourself hi i'm skyler \ni'm working as a freelancer and have achieved some great success with my work making nearly 400 000 last year \nthat's very impressive though however today we won't go deep about your success story \nbut we want to talk about your time management okay interesting \ni've heard many successful freelancers say that they have the same problem which is that they overwork and mess up \ntheir timetable and health [Applause] oh yeah \ni guess as a freelance sooner or later you will have to face that issue \nso how about you i used to have that period when everything was overwhelming and it \naffected my health a lot how about now now i never work more than 30 hours a \nweek and i have a lot of free time for myself and still generating income \nyes definitely by building a system and having people work for you as you mentioned you have a lot of free \ntime do you feel boring of course not if you know how to fill up your free \ntime in the right way how do you do that first pick up a hobby or skill that you \nwant to invest a lot of your time into hobby or skill yes for example \neven when my work contains a lot of writing i still write a lot in my free time \nwhy because i love writing and it doesn't feel like i'm working \nand you see what i write down can eventually benefit me one day yeah do you have any other hobbies \nyes i enjoy gardening oh well that's a great hobby \nyes now i have a small garden full of flowers and trees it's beautiful \nokay any other way to fill up your free time cooking i have a lot of time to cook so \nwhy would i not make myself delicious meals right i have to admit that spending hours in \nthe kitchen making something nice is very satisfying yeah \nalso i'm a fan of video games you know do anything as long as it makes you happy yeah \nhow about youtube and netflix i mean yeah if you love watching things on those platforms that's fine \ndon't you like it no i'm not a fan because it's really wasting time if you have no control of \nyourself yeah true is there anything else you want to share \nwith us today yes the final one is having too much free time isn't really a bad thing \nenjoy it while it lasts and make use of it in a way that makes you feel happy thanks a lot for joining us today \nwe really appreciate it [Music] \nhow much leisure time do you give yourself per day [Music] \nwhat are you thinking about joe uh nothing i'm just trying to replan my life \nso how's it going uh not that great basically i'm trying to fix my daily \nroutine what's wrong with it now i'm not very productive \n[Music] okay you're trying to make a daily schedule \nor what no i'm thinking about how much leisure time i should give myself per day \nhave you figured it out not yet something is not right so i'm kind of \nconfused to me saying oh i have two free time hours what \nshould i do today to fit that two hour is so weird yeah true \nso any suggestions i think you overthink a bit \nfor me leisure time can be anytime i feel relaxed like having coffee before \nwork in the morning [Music] yes but i want to be a bit stricter to \nmyself you know in that case you should schedule a day depending on what the priorities of that day are \npriorities yes then finish them the time left is your \nfree time easy sounds nice though right it's a flexible plan as well \nbecause some days when i need my work done i can have no free time \nand some days you can just lay down chilling for like five hours right \nexactly because the goal is being productive right as long as you finish what you need to \ndo you can relax for the rest of the day \nwow thanks a lot mary super nice idea you have and really reasonable \nnot at all i'm just saying from my personal experience \n[Music] that color looks good on you \n[Music] \nmommy i'm looking for a new dress for my prom do you have a favorite one yet \ni like this one it is so pretty isn't it wow it looks so fabulous \nbut are you
