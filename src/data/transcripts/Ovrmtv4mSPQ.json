\nBella there are so many vegetables which \nones should we buy \nwe'll buy kale spinach and broccoli \nwhy \nbecause they only have a few calories \nand carbohydrates \nbut contain a lot of fiber vitamins and \nminerals that's very good for weight \nloss \nhow about tomatoes and potatoes do you \nthink we should buy them \ntomatoes are very low in calories and \nhigh in fiber we should buy

foods what \nabout beef \nI'm not going to buy beef \n[Music] \nsome types of red meat are high in \nsaturated fat and increase cholesterol \nlevels in the blood \noh that makes sense \nyou often buy
