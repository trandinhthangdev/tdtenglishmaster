what kind of room are you interested in \njust a standard room would be fine okay our standard rooms are priced at \none hundred and fifty dollars per night so for three nights it would come out to \n450 dollars oh that's a bit more than I was expecting \nare there any other options that are a bit more affordable we do have a smaller room available for \n100 per night it's not as spacious but it might be more in line with your budget \nI think we'll go with that one how much do I have to pay up front you'll need to pay for the first night \nin advance which comes out to a hundred dollars and then we'll charge your credit card \nfor the remaining two nights when you check out sounds good can I pay with my debit card \nof course let me just process the payment for the first night here's my card \nand there you go all set thank you so much [Music] \nJump in with both feet \njump in with both feet [Music] \nwhy do you always argue with Jessica she always annoys me I can't stand her \nanymore uh well as I see it you are too fastidious \nAnna I think you shouldn't jump in with both feet do you know what she did to me \nwhat did she do she took my workbook and copied it without my consent \nafter I confronted her she denied it so we argued I didn't know that \nwhen you came I was talking loud so you just thought I was the one who started it \nI'm sorry it's okay don't worry I just wanted to ask and reconcile the \ntwo of you thank you but it's okay now she will never act like that anymore I believe it \n[Music] \nI think I can do it myself [Music] \nI think I can do it
