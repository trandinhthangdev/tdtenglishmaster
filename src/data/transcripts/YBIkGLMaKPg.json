date how much is this that dress is currently on sale for \n$75 okay I'll take it \nNew project \nnew \nproject all right team today we will brainstorm for the upcoming campaign for \nour new fitness tracker sounds exciting who are we aiming \nat we will Target young adults who want to stay fit so the message must sound energetic \nright it's something young people can connect with maybe we could use social media \ninfluencers they have a lot of reach with our target audience that's a smart suggestion \nBella now let's talk about where to advertise I would suggest using \nInstagram and Tik Tok lots of young people use them for fitness motivation what if we create funny skits \non Tik Tok to introduce the track ER by that way we could attract younger \ncustomers I agree Everyone Falls for entertainment what about a catchy slogan \nfor the campaign how about track your way to \nFitness or maybe unlock your potential with the tracker's name included that \nsounds more powerful those are both great options we will fix them \nlater now any idea is for offline media channels what about college campuses we \ncould set up booths with free trials and contests we could also give free goodies \nwith every track or purchase everyone loves free stuff right that's right \nfreebies always attract attention this is so productive guys we've had so many good ideas \nalready we will take a small break before the next discussion \nlet's go get some coffee \nguys a trip to \nA trip to Paris \nParis Bella can you believe we're actually in Paris I know right it feels like a \ndream first
