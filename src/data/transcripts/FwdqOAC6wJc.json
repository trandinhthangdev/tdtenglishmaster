for food scraps when cutting fresh \ningredients great and you \nthe most challenging aspect of cooking was choosing the spices and herbs for each dish \nbecause none of them were similar but thanks to your course I'm better at it \nyou guys tried your best however there are still some things you need to learn \nand practice more do you want to take part in one more \ncourse with me great idea

choose \nKate minus Thomas \nokay you can choose whomever you want but there are some rules for the \ncompetition of course every competition needs its own rules \nwhatever what are they need to go buy all ingredients \nangry yourself no problem I know a lot of stores [Music] \nso do I live but some spices are similar be careful \nand I will give you a limited amount of money just a little money \nyeah it makes everything harder okay no problem I know what I should buy \nmost of it is cheap you have never gone to the market by yourself I'm confident that I can defeat \nyou let's see \nthe loser needs to have one more cooking course okay \nokay it won't be me so it's fine \n[Music] \nI made a shopping list for us let me see there are a lot of things do \nyou have enough money I think

\nrequired less ingredients okay do you think that you're going to win \nof course I'm super confident little did Henry know he can't cook perfectly \nwithout help he has Thomas is he good at cooking \nI don't know but nothing can defeat me this time how confident you are \nabsolutely look what I have what is that \nHenry's recipe and shopping list oh my how did you get that \nI saw it on the

this is a little too much no we need all of it \noh my God why is there only a little money left what happened \nI don't know I thought Mom gave us lots of cash you can pay by credit card \nI didn't bring it with me what can we do now we may be late if we go back home to get \nmore money yeah we don't have enough time [Music] \nleave some unnecessary things oh my I can't \nif you don't have time choose the main ingredients okay \n[Music] \nI can't find our shopping list what \nI'm not sure [Music] I'm sure I put it on the dining table but it's gone \nwhat can we do now no no I can't do
