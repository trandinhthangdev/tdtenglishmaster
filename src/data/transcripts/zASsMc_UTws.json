see you bye \nMini garden of herbs and spices \nmini garden of herbs and spices [Music] \n[Applause] hi jane welcome to my home \nhi linda come here come here i want to show you an interesting thing \nyou make me curious what is that it's in the kitchen \nis that a dish you make no more interesting than that \nthis wow is that a mini garden of herbs and spices \nyes i did it last week i thought and decided to make a mini garden like this \nwhat do you think it's really great thanks \nhow could you think of growing herbs on the windowsill that's really smart linda \nbecause my house is on the fifth floor there is no garden planting them here will save space \nof course the kitchen area looks very neat yes \nlet me see what did you plant a lot i have parsley \nbasil here is chili and some turmeric as well \nyou can save a lot of money when you plant them yourself it's my purpose too and is this rosemary \nor mint it's mint it is used to decorate desserts or to mix drinks \nyes i love that oh what is this i have no idea about this one \nit's nutmeg ah i've heard that but this is the first time i see it \nvery nice next week i'm going to plant some others such as ginger and garlic \nthat sounds interesting you are like a botanist i'm a big fan of herbs and spices \nHerbs and spices for health \nherbs and spices for health \njane what's wrong with you you look not good yes i'm a bit tired maybe because of the \nweather changes last week how do you feel sometimes i feel nauseous \nfor the past two days my nasal congestion has been getting worse \ni feel extremely tired because i can't breathe too bad you should go to the doctor \nright now i don't want to use medicines because it has some side effects \nfor example drowsiness and in long term will lead to drug resistance \nah how about using herbs to reduce these symptoms really does it work \nyes of course my mother tried it before that sounds great how \npeppermint can reduce nausea significantly you can use menthol in the room it has a great anti-nausea effect \namazing yes my mother had the same symptoms as you she has used menthol and is no \nlonger nauseated but actually i don't like the smell of mint \nso you can use ginger instead really yes one gram or more of ginger can \nsuccessfully treat nausea i will try it and to deal with nasal congestion \nrosemary is the best treatment the rosmarinic acid in it can treat this \nkind of symptom some people told me cinnamon can also reduce nasal congestion is that right \nto be honest i have known that cinnamon lowers blood sugar levels and has a powerful anti-diabetic effect but as far \nas its effect on nasal congestion i don't know okay thank you so much linda \nyou're welcome hope you get better soon [Music] \nsingle lifestyle \n[Music] hi jenny long time no see how are you \nhi jessica i'm fine how are you never better jenny how was your life \nafter marriage we're very happy you know we had been together for five years before marriage \nhow about you jessica any news i'm glad to hear you are happy \ni'm still very into my single life i know i know but do you have any plans \nfor the near future what do you think about marriage to me getting married is not a priority \nright now you know i'm pretty ambitious i want to focus on my career and achieve certain \nresults first yeah but do you think you can actually develop your career even after you get \nmarried i know but it won't be possible to concentrate 100 percent \ngetting married then having children parenting will take a lot of time and concentration \nalso raising children is expensive what i want is to achieve financial \nstability before having children so that i can provide the best things to them so \nit's best to not get married early yeah that makes sense \nmoreover the previous betrayal made me no longer believe in love \nin addition the divorce rate is high in our country 3 out of 10 people get divorced this really makes me have to \nconsider marriage i got it but you should open up to people too \nnot everyone is as bad as your ex i believe you will soon find the man of your life \nthank you very much jenny you're welcome [Music] \ndon't drink while driving [Music] \ncheck equipment walkie-talkie police card gun drug tester alcohol tester \nlook at this motorbike first case \nmotorbike ahead move across the motorcycle's lane and pull over \nhello officer how are you hi do you know why i asked you to pull over \nbecause my car is so beautiful car you are riding a motorbike \noh let's be fun sir show me your driver's license and registration id card and proof of \ninsurance why sir what was wrong with me \ni reserve the right to ask you to show your personal documents to check and you drive a motorbike but you cross the lane \nfor cars okay sure officer i'm just kidding \ni will test your alcohol now you have a smell of alcohol i actually had a drink a little very \nlittle now keep your hand down and i want you to blow hard into port \nyour alcohol level didn't exceed the legal limit luckily i told you \nhere's your violation record and your ticket you can pay the fine online if you have any questions or you see \nsomething wrong you can appeal to the court i almost had the turn left so i went to \nthe car lane but i got there too soon it still has a long road to turn \nwhatever no matter how much you drink
