with your hair I just watched a video this morning \nkind of this one hello Beauties today I will show you \nhow I get my layer haircut I had a lot of questions about haircuts and I decided to cut it by \nmyself there are several easy steps firstly getting your hair ready \nfor a layer cut divide your your hair into sections make a ponytail at the top of \nyour head Slide the elastic down the length of your hair cut off the end of your hair then \nremove the elastic and examine your layers I'm done this is my hair after I do cut it \nby myself it looks so perfect doesn't it how stupid I am

to work \ntomorrow calm down Lisa let me see your hair first then we can decide if we can \nfix it by ourselves it turned out that she watched a tutorial video on the internet \nthen she had a haircut by herself but it failed the front looked good but the \nback was messy it looks bad really I don't want to scare you but it \nis yes I think so Lisa you should cut it too short \nhair really I was going to cut layers I still want to keep long hair is there \nany way no way Lisa you should ask ask for our advice \nbefore doing it my bad may you help me fix it I'm \nafraid of being laughed at

arrange an appointment \nyes wait for me a minute what time is better for you \nLisa as soon as possible please I can't look at myself in the mirror even for a \nminute when is the earliest time to

eat \ncake there are 3 hours [Music] \n[Music] left \nthat afternoon they went to the hair salon to fix Lisa's mistake Emma and Rosie waited for Lisa in the \nlobby oh my God what did you do with your hair I guess you learned cutting \nhair on the internet didn't you how do you know in recent days many girls have come \nhere to fix their failed hair don't trust just 100% in what you \nwatch on the internet luckily your hair is long so it's easy to fix if yours was short it \nwould be a hard case yes once and for all I don't think I can fix it to keep \nthis layer style you can cut it into short hair I'm okay with \nit okay I have a catalog here so you can have a look let me know which style you \nwant \n[Music] finally Lisa had to have short hair the hairdresser helped her to have a
