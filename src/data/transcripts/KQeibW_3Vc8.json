layout but have you considered adding \nmore color to make it poomp that's a good point I was a bit \nworried it might be too distracting but the right colors could actually enhance it exactly just a few accents here and \nthere could really draw the eye without overwhelming the content I hadn't thought of that thanks \nfor the feedback Maya [Music] \nwhere would you like to go for [Music] \nlunch I'm getting pretty hungry where would you like to go for \nlunch I was thinking the same thing how about that new thae place that \nopened up downtown sounds good to \nme I've heard they have some

this \nweek I thought it would give us more time to prepare but I don't understand what you \nmean about needing more time though weren't we almost ready we are but I received an update \nfrom the

and time perfect I'll look out for that thanks for explaining \n[Music] Louise can you show me how to do this \n[Music] I've been trying to figure out how to \nuse this new software for our project but I'm stuck on one of the \nfeatures oh which feature are you having trouble with it's the part where we need \nto integrate the data from our last project I'm not sure how to set it up \ncorrectly I can help with that I went through a tutorial last week really that would be great let me \nopen the software and I'll show you where I'm \nstuck okay I see the issue you need to import the data using this tool here not \nthe one you were trying I see I didn't realize there were two different tools for that it's easy \nto miss let me walk you through the correct process that's much clearer now thanks \nfor showing me how to do it Sara no problem Liam if you have any more questions just let me \n[Music] know that was a fantastic \nmovie wow that was a fantastic movie what did you think Mia I loved it the storyline was so \ninteresting and the special effects were incredible right the way they designed \nthose scenes in outer space made me feel feel like I was actually there and the music added so much to the \natmosphere it really built up the tension and excitement \ndefinitely do you have a favorite part it's hard to choose but I think the \nfinal confrontation was my favorite it was so well done how about you for me it \nwas the plot twist near the end I did not see that coming at all oh that was a \nshocker for sure I'm glad we decided to see it do you want to grab
