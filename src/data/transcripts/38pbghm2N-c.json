Billy if they become heirs they will destroy everything don't worry Brad we still \nhave Frank you're right Frank is a bit clumsy \nand shy but affectionate and intelligent he said that he will develop \nthe farm because it's your passion yes he's a good boy he knows how \nto abs observe and solve problems smoothly I want Frank to inherit the \nfarm but you just can't hand over all of the things to Frank because it's not \nfair Yuri and Billy won't be satisfied with that yes you're right \nagain what should we do I have an \nidea what is it Candice please go to their room \nand tell
