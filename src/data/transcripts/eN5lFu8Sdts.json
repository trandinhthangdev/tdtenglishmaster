if they don't listen to you \nwill you get mad \nyeah \nso \nare you mad at layla for some reason \nyeah you're right \nyou see \nthis habit can badly affect \nrelationships \nyeah but she came to me every single \ntime they broke up \nshould i not give her advice \nyes \nshe might just need someone to share \nwhen she gets emotional not to be told \nwhat to do \ni've never thought of that way \nlet people manage their own lives and if \nthey fail let them fail on their own \nwhat if they ask for advice \nof course feel free to express your \nopinion but don't get mad if they don't \nfollow

boyfriend \ndid he say something hurtful \nno \nactually me who did that \nreally \nyeah i was angry then i said some really \nbad things to him \nit's okay \ni think he won't hold it against you \ni know but i feel disappointed in myself \nare you regretting it now \nyeah \ni'm such \ntempered i shouldn't say those things \nthe thing is \ndo you want to change \nyes \ni think i may have had this habit for \ntoo long it's so easy to lose control \n[Music] \ndon't let your anger get the best of you \nand regret it later \nwhat should i do now \nfirstly you should make peace with him \ni will \nsecondly next time something sets you \noff \nkeep your mouth shut before you say \nanything \nthat's very difficult \njust leave the room take three deep \nbreaths and think about what you're \nfeeling \nso going away first \nyeah think about the best way to handle \nthe situation \nthat's so mature of you to talk about \nthings like this \ni'm just talking from personal \nexperience been there done that \nreally did you have an emotional \nexplosion too \nyes \ni hurt many relationships because of \nthat bad habit \nthen i decided to change \ni didn't know that \nin my mind you're always a very calm \nperson \nwell \npractice makes perfect try the things i \ntold you \nyes i will \nthanks a lot for the advice \n[Music] \nTaking Action \ndelay taking action \n[Music] \nlily what are you doing \nuh nothing much i'm looking at my goal \nlists \noh the one you made at the end of the \nyear \nyes \nhow much have you achieved until now \nit may be ridiculous but \nnothing \nwhat seriously \nyeah \nbut why \ni don't know i still look at the list \nevery day and dream about the day when i \nachieved them \n[Music] \noh so you mean you're just thinking \nabout the success but not doing anything \nyeah \nnow when you mention it i realized it's \ntrue though \nmany people make this mistake too having \nbig dreams but they never step toward \ntheir ambitions \nbut you know sometimes i feel like there \nare so many things to do i don't even \nknow where to start \n[Music] \nthat's why you need an action plan and \nfollow it not just saying i have a dream \naction plan \nyes \nthe important thing is that you need a \ndetailed action plan with deadlines \nwhy deadlines \nyou won't be able to accomplish anything \nwithout deadlines \nyou're right \nuntil now i just keep thinking about \nwhat if i succeed but not about doing \nthe thing \nyou know what \nthe hardest part is the beginning it \ntakes a lot of courage to start \n[Applause] \n[Music] \nyeah but what if you are demotivated \nremember this \nonly when you take action you will get \ncloser to success \nyes \nso it's about action and not about \nmotivation at all \nno need for motivation inspiration \nit's good if you have but if not say to \nyourself \njust do it \nthanks a lot for those wide words jane \n[Music] \nMaterial Happiness \nmaterial happiness \n[Music] \nhey what are you thinking about tony you \nlook so lost \nuh nothing are you happy with your life \nnow \nwhy so suddenly of course i am \ni'm just thinking about happiness though \nwhat's wrong \nyou know \ni had nothing all i tried was to work \nharder and harder and to get closer to \nsuccess \n[Music] \nyes you did work so hard \nnow when i had somehow achieved a bit i \nstill don't feel happy \nhmm \ni think you are seeking the meaning of \nlife aren't you \nyeah kind of \ni was happy when i bought my first house \nmy first car \n[Music] \nbut then \nno feeling anymore \nsure what gives your life meaning it's \nnot the car the house money \nbut the people that love you the \nexperiences you gain and the passions \nthat expire you \nyeah \ni kind of regretted focusing too much on \nmaterial things before \nwhat did you think before \nbefore i just focused on making money \nexpanding my source of income things \nlike that \nwere you happy back then \nto be honest \ni don't know \ni spent the whole time working and \ntrying to reach success \ni think you should discover meaning \nelsewhere \nelsewhere \ni mean \nnot only from material things or money \nbut from the smallest things around you \nsuch as from your relationships or \ndiving deeper into your interests \nyeah \ni should learn how to be happy again \nhappiness is within you tony \nit's not hard to find happiness as you \nthink \nthanks

a horrible experience that i \nwould not want to relive \noh dear \ntell me what happened please \nmy family was driving home when a big \ntruck crashed into our passenger side \nafter the accident i blacked out and was \ntransported to the hospital \nwhen i regained consciousness \ni discovered that i had five broken \nbones several ruptures \nand many cuts and bruises \ndid you have any treatments after that \nto restore the collarbone and leg bone i \nhad to go through operations during \nwhich metal rods were put onto these \nbones to fix them \nnot surprisingly i was in severe pain \nso physicians prescribed me to take \npainkillers and other medicines for a \ncouple of weeks \nhow long did it take you to recover \nduring my recovery i wasn't able to walk \nproperly and my life then was very \ndifficult \nbut after several months of proper \ntreatment and physical therapy i fully \nrecovered \ndoes your life change a lot after \ni even took up karate soon after

are healthy now \nyes i think so as well \nwhat about you did you experience a lot \nof illness \nwell i guess i will tell you about one \nmemorable experience it happened a few \nmonths ago when i had of the flu coupled \nwith a sore throat \nwhat happened \na week before it happened i was so \nstressed with work i had stayed up \nlate in the night in the office to meet \nseveral deadlines \na lack of sleep and i couldn't also eat \non time \noh you must have been really tired \nmy body started to feel weak i started \nto have slight fever and colds \ni knew it was going to be bad because i \nwas having headaches \nand severe muscle and body aches \ni also started to have a dry cough and \nmy throat hurt \ndid you go see the doctor \nit lasted for about a week i went to see \na doctor so i could get the right \nprescription \ni was advised to have bed rest for a few \ndays \ni was not able to report to work for a \nweek \nluckily i have already finished all of \nmy deadlines before it happened \nbut it had still affected my life \nbecause i had failed to do my daily \nroutine \ni also asked my mom to take care of me \nsince i lived alone \nwhen i went back to work there was a \nhuge pile of paperwork waiting on my \ndesk \nhow was the health care system in your \ncountry \ncosta rica is actually a pretty healthy \ncountry \nwe have one of the only five blue zones \nin the world \nwhich are these areas where because of \ntheir lifestyle population frequently \nreaches a hundred years or more \nis that one good signal about your \ncountry \nbut unsurprisingly one of the major \nhealth problems that we face is obesity \nbecause our modern lives are so \nfrequently making us sedentary and \nworking in office spaces and in closed \nrooms \nespecially under the current conditions \nwe tend to become overweight \nthat's true \nkeeping a healthy lifestyle is not a \npriority for a lot of people \nespecially because they have very busy \nroutines you know that being said it is \nimportant to keep a healthy lifestyle \nand it's one of those problems that the \nentire world seems to be facing \nat the moment i don't belong to a gym \nbut i go jogging \nusually i go jogging four times a week \nand i also go in the morning because for \nme it's the best time to exercise \nbecause it keeps me awake all day but at \nthe moment i don't do any other exercise \nwow just the running \njust the running \nso what do you do to keep fit \nmany things but i think discipline is \none of the most important things \nyou need to be a disciplined person \nis it hard to become a disciplined \nperson \na little bit disciplined person \nbut saying that it's not hard to be \ndisciplined because you do things that \nyou like to do for example \ni do yoga and i enjoy yoga so every day \ni get up in the morning and i do an hour \nof yoga and this is very good for your \nbody \nwell \nso basically one of the pillars of your \nway of staying healthy is to have the \ndiscipline to exercise regularly \nbut it doesn't have to be strenuous just \nlittle things \na little bit of exercise every day \nsomething simple something easy \nsomething you like to do \nwhether it's walking or whether it's \nriding your bicycle to work instead of \ntaking the subway \nor \nyeah doing some yoga \ni guess you are a sporty person is that \nright \nnot really just a little bit of exercise \na few days a week and it will help you \nstay fit and healthy \ndo you have a healthy diet \nreasonably healthy i'm semi-vegetarian \nso i don't eat meat i only eat fish and \ni eat lots of fruits and vegetables \nhave you ever eaten fast food \nwell i also like my junk food and \nusually once a day i eat either potato \nchips or cake \nso yeah i have a balanced diet \nwhat kind of fruits do you like to eat \nwell i like all fruits \ni love all fruits except pineapple \ni hate pineapple i don't know why \ni just don't like pineapple \ni don't like the taste i don't like to \nchew it it just feels funny \nbut i love apples i love bananas i love \noranges \ni usually have an apple every morning \nfor breakfast it's very easy to eat \nand i just love apples because you can \ntake them to school \nyou can eat them quickly \nthey're very easy to eat \nme too i also like oranges \nand i love orange juice \nso sometimes i make fresh orange juice \nin my kitchen \nand i love to eat bananas and \nstrawberries together \nso my favorite snack is to cut up some \nbananas and then cut up some \nstrawberries and mix them together and \nthen eat them \nwell
