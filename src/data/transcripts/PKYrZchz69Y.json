\nlunch you know I love food so what will \nyou eat for \nlunch H maybe a sandwich or something \nI'm not too \npicky you have the flu I think you \nshould have hot soup for \nlunch I'm craving \nsushi sushi sounds good but I could go \nfor a big salad too trying to eat \nhealthier this week \nhuh yeah salads are always a safe bet \nmorning \neveryone morning sir sir sorry to \ninterrupt just a quick \nannouncement sure sir we're \nlistening starting today there's a new \nrule between 10 and 10:30 no one can use \nthe emergency \nexit uh why sir is everything okay don't \nworry it's just the new rule so remember \nbetween 10 and 10:30 no one can use the \nemergency exit except for emergencies \nlike fire or power outage of course all \nright back to work everyone have a good \nmorning did you catch that what's up \nwith the boss in his weird \nRu all right not using the emergency \nexit between 10 and \n10:30 seems \nOD yeah like why specifically during \nthat time \nand why announce it out of nowhere hey \nMark how do you feel about the boss's \nstrange \nannouncement \num we were just wondering what you make \nof it any thoughts honestly I have no \nclue seems odd but maybe there's a \nreason behind it who \nknows he's trying to keep us in the dark \nabout \nsomething well whatever it is it's \ndefinitely strange \nI guess we'll have to wait and see if \nanything comes of it agreed but I'm \nkeeping an eye out for any more Oddities \nfrom now \n[Music] \non get back to \n[Music] \nwork Harry boss didn't seem all that \ndifferent after the announcement \nyeah maybe we're just overthinking thing \nprobably let's just focus on our work \nfor now agreed it's probably \nnothing do you see what I \nsee I see what you see that black \n[Music] \nbag boss just went toward the emergency \nexit with a black \nB yeah that's \nstrange I thought he said no one's \nallowed to use the emergency exit during \nthis time and he changed his clothes \nhe's wearing a white shirt now but this \nmorning he wore a black \n[Music] \nshirt so weird \n[Music] \nhey Mark how's the preparation for the \nlaunch of our new product at the end of \nthe month \ngoing oh it's going well sir we're \nfinalizing the marketing strategy and \nensuring everything is on track \nexcellent to hear keep up the good work \nwe'll do thank you \nsir boss changed into a black \nshirt yeah should we say something or \ninvestigate I'm not sure I just \nremembered that I need to work to a \ndeadline \ntomorrow true I also have to submit a \nreport to the boss \n[Music] \ntomorrow I can't stop thinking about it \nGwen what do you think the boss is up to \nwith all this secretive \nBehavior honestly I have no idea but \nit's driving crazy why the black bag why \ndid he change his shirt do you think \nhe's secretly practicing some weird \nritual or something or maybe he's \ninvolved in some kind of mystery \noperation you know like a spy or \nsomething what's in that bag it's like a \nmystery waiting to be \nunraveled I know let's make a \nguess maybe it's filled with classified \ndocuments or diamonds or chocolate \nbars what if he's hiding a beautiful \nmistress \nsomewhere oh \nplease maybe that's why he's always \nchanging his shirt trying to impress her \nor something or maybe he just spills \ncoffee on himself but seriously I'm so \ncurious should we take a peek and see \nwhat he's really up \nto are you serious that's Risky \nBusiness come on Terry we'll never know \nunless we try plus think of the thrill \nof uncovering a \nsecret okay fine but if we get caught \nI'm blaming you such a good friend let's \ngo let's \n[Music] \ngo boss just went to the emergency exit \nI see let's try to catch him in the ACT \nagreed but let's be discreet though I'll \npretend to panic and you play your \nphone's emergency \nalarm got \nit get your phone \nready oh my gosh what's going on is \nthere a \nfire what are you two doing here we \nheard the alarm and got \nworried what worried you doing in \nhere why did you worry when that alarm \nis a false \nalarm is that a \ncat \nCat Let's Talk inside \n[Music] \nso were you two spying on me no sir we \nwere just curious that's all that false \nalarm was our \nmistake yeah we didn't mean any harm we \nwere just trying to figure out what was \ngoing \non yes we apologize for any \ninconvenience it was \nunprofessional of us no need to \napologize it's partly my fault for \nimplementing such a weird \nrule can we ask why the cat is \nhere yeah let me \nexplain every day at 10:00 a.m. a stray \ncat comes to the emergency exit looking \nfor \nfood I really love cats so I spend time \nwith it feeding and playing for 30 \nminutes that's \nunexpected but what about the black bag \nand your changing \nshirts the bag contains food for the cat \nand I change shirts to avoid bringing \ncat hair home my wife is allergic so I \ncan't have a cat and home bring it in \nthat's \nwhy but why did you create that new rule \nwhen you can still feed and play with \nyour cat whenever you \nwant because I prefer to keep that \nprivate to maintain my strict image at \nwork ah I see that makes sense \nbut sir there's nothing to be ashamed of \nfor loving animals in fact it's \nadmirable yeah I like animal \nlovers you're right I suggest you \nconsider keeping the cat in the office \nsir yeah it creates a positive \nenvironment in our office you think \nso absolutely imagine if we all took \nturns caring for the cat it could be a \nsymbol of good luck for the company \nit would bring us all closer together as \na team you know what that actually \nsounds like a great \nidea sorry again anyway \nsir well next time maybe just ask me \ndirectly if you're curious about \nsomething yes sir we'll keep that in \nmind by the way I need to know your \nprogress on the project as I remember \ntoday's the \ndeadline yeah sure we're almost done \nyeah we'll have it ready
