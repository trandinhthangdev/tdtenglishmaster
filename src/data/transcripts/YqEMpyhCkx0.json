congratulations what is the reason behind this \nthis quarter our sales are amazingly taking off that makes sense that the economy as a \nwhole is improving there's something i've observed people are spending a lot at this moment \ni believe this is because the government has reduced interest rates \nright my father recently purchased a new home due to cheap interest rates \nperhaps you should do the same at this moment considering purchasing a new home \ni can't afford that right now you certainly can i believe you can buy \na new apartment perhaps you are correct yet a solid economy may lead property \nvalues to climb especially the rising house prices \nbelieve me it will increase but not right now you should quickly buy a new apartment \nwhy you know you're a real estate agent oh no but my husband is \nhere's his business card i think he has to thank you for helping me with the sale \nif you tell him you know me he could offer you a good bargain i'll contact him thanks \ndialogue 2

are rising what should we do \nstart an import business what are your thoughts what kind of products are you aiming for \ni was considering japanese and american electronic devices \nyou know that sony is the best selling brand in various nations it's a good idea \nsony is a good product quality assurance okay but we'll need to perform \nsome market research to figure out who our target market is \nwho our rivals are and who will handle distribution and so on \nyeah it's a lot of work to do but i've done it before i'll make some market research \ngreat market research is also extremely important and i will do a survey \nfirst look at wholesale prices it makes no sense to begin market \nresearch if we cannot earn a profit after deducting all transportation costs \nthat'll do is there anything else attempt to obtain statistics on the \npeople aged 25 to 40. i believe they will be viable market for \nus also look at this age group's disposable income \nokay i got it i'm getting excited already food \ndialogue one \noh are you going to the supermarket right i'm going right now what's up \ncould you choose a few items for me sure what do you want to buy \ni'm in need of some

you can choose the fruit you like okay i think i'll leave now \nthank you very much not a big deal dialogue too \nlook there are frozen peas frozen beans and frozen carrots at the supermarket \nso what i normally buy frozen vegetables and store them in the freezer until needed \nwhat about fresh vegetables they don't sell fresh vegetables here \nyep but in the summer during the summer farmers may set up vegetable stalls alongside the road or \nhave a farmer's market in town don't you think fresh produce is better \nbecause the growing season in the northern united states is shorter we must rely on frozen veggies \nthroughout the winter oh okay \ndialogue three what shall we have for dinner \nbitter melon have you ever tried it yeah i gave it a go but i'm not a big \nfan of it if you like it you may order it what about a sweet and sour combination \ndo you enjoy sweet and sour flavors could we have sweet and sour fish or \nsweet and sour pork what about some sweet and sour beef \ncome on we're in china here they don't eat sweet and sour beef \nit's sad why is that they exclusively serve chinese cuisine \nnot western cuisine plans and intentions \ndialogue one \nhey jake what are you busy with i'm working on a master social plan \nwow that sounds really macroscopic yeah i wish to contribute to a better \nsociety and how do you intend to do this \nby establishing equality for all there is no such thing as private property \nis everyone work yes for the benefit of everybody not \njust individuals what if some individuals work harder and more efficient than others \nthey will not be permitted to exert influence over others do you mean it's \njust as nice to be lazy as it is to be hard-working workers and peasants will rule society \nthey are not as lazy as industrial owners by moving a plow a man may control a \nfactory or an economy you can learn so what was he doing before that driving \na plow what about the arts culture and higher education \nwhat are peasants supposed to know about it a former can also draw pictures \nbut i am sure that you will never hang it on your wall my plan will one day change the world \nperhaps but i wouldn't want to live in such a world dialogue 2 \ni plan to return to university in the fall for my master's degree what major are you planning to study \nwhat plan do you have i'd like to change careers i'd want to work in the

or institute will you attend to get my master's degree i have to go \nto texas they are the only ones to offer this dual specialist and master's degree \nprogram is it rather pricey no i intend to do some internship work \nwhile i'm there i'd want to gain some hands-on experience they offer a public relations \nprogram in which i may participate you planned everything what will you do if your plans are \nthwarted then i punt punt what exactly is it \nit means i will try something new dialogue three \nwhen i grow up become extremely beautiful i will be pursued by prince charlie \nhe'll bring me into his castle and we will be playing the greatest computer games \nand watching tv throughout the day and i never have any schoolwork to complete \nkeep dreaming princess because tomorrow you'll go to school early and finish all your schoolwork again when you return \nhome all my dreams are continuously being \nruined by you talents and abilities \ndialogue one do you fond of jazz music \nactually yeah i used to play a bit when i was in college really i couldn't play an instrument \nwhat instrument do you play i played the trumpet during college \nwow you are very talented now

it it's already perfect \nyou could spoil it if you modify it just leave it alone do you truly enjoy it so much \nyeah it's great you have a lot of talent you are a real painter \ni can tell you're pulling my leg now pulling your leg what does this imply \nit means you're joking no i'm not kidding your painting is \nundeniably beautiful dialogue three \nhave you any special abilities i wouldn't say i have any special \ncapabilities but when i was younger i used to write a lot and people were always surprised by \nmy poems why don't you do it anymore it was an obsession in the past for me \ni'd rather live a regular life now sorry to hear that but do you think you \ncould have achieved fame if you had persisted i think possibly \nmy friend barry is an example he and i used to fantasize about taking \nover the literary world he persisted and ultimately he was \nsuccessful very famous in the literary world i don't believe he was any more gifted \nthan i was why did you quit up when he was successful \ni prefer to eat than write making appointments \ndialogue one can we change the time from today to tomorrow at 10 o'clock \nsure no problem are you sure you can make it if you can't make it just call me and we \ncan make another date no don't change it 10 is perfect for me \nok see you then bye goodbye \ndialogue 2. \ni thought we had a meeting at 10 a.m why didn't you show up \ni was told to let me know if the time wasn't right for you why are you upset with me look at the \nclock it's not time it's only nine o'clock now our appointment was scheduled for 10 am \nnot 10 pm why don't you tell me the appointment in the morning or in the evening so i \nassumed you meant 10 pm you are insane people do not schedule \nappointments for 10 pm yes i do that's all you're incredibly \nnarrow-minded dialogue three \ni have a meeting with mr harris at three o'clock for what \nto discuss a new business venture project is that mr david harris or mr robert \nterrace i'm not certain he just addressed himself as mr harris \nwell it's most likely david i'll inquire no it isn't him so it's got to be robert \nhe is in room 306 on the third level you may now get up there \nthank you very much [Music] \nfeelings and emotions dialogue one \nwhat's the problem what i never said anything was wrong \nhe seemed to be agitated really i have a lot of thoughts going through \nmy head right now is everything okay yeah \nthere aren't any major issues it's just a small problem tell me what is it \nwell i'm a little worried about work because i recently applied for a transfer to another office \nthat is enough to make anyone scared when will you learn the outcome about three or four days \nrelax you seem exhausted that's because the job is really hard \nand i also have to study for a class at night wow you're undoubtedly feeling a lot of \npressure yes i think so i'm going to take a vacation shortly \ngood idea you should take a break after a period of hard work dialogue too \ni'm feeling very sad because i couldn't make it to wade's wedding \nhe will sympathize with you he knows that you are unable to return from china at that time \num about wade's wife i don't like her very much i understand that \nit may take time for you to get along with kate your new sister-in-law \ni'm not going to speak with her she's arrogant and rude anyway she's your sister-in-law \nif you do like that you'll make wade awkward i know when are you going to be able to return \nhome on or around july 11th i'm homesick for home and miss everyone \nit won't be long clothing dialogue one \nwhat can i do for you yes please i want to find a jacket \nwhat kind of jacket are you looking for [Music] this black wool coat appeals to me \nhere it is i'll get it for you to see yes however i loved a navy blue hue more \nshow me the one over there what about this do you want to try it on \ni feel this shoulder is a bit tight for me so let me get you a bigger size \nokay except for the arms this fits well the sleeves of this jacket are a bit long \ni see we can fix it to make it fit for you is it possible to cut a jacket here \nyeah our tailor will fix it for you i will take your measurements now \nour tailor will arrive at work in the afternoon today what time is it \nat 2pm i'll return at that time to ensure he obtains the correct measurements \nokay is there anything else i can do for you no not just now maybe when i return \nokay thank you for visiting have a wonderful day \nyou as well goodbye dialogue too \ni want to have a traditional chinese dress like this design can you do it \ndo you mean a keeper right i want it to look like this design \ni like a black background with red jackets looks good this is a very traditional \ndesign what is its price depending on the fabric you choose \nsilk is more expensive but it has more appealing appearance of course polyester is less expensive \nhow many meters of fabric do i need for this dress this also depends on your height the \nlength of the sleeves and the neckline i want the sleeve length to be 3 4 with \nslits along the sides i got it it will probably take about 2 \nmeters and you also need to buy a lining for it what about those beautiful tiny \nfasteners on the dress oh in china those are referred to as buttons \nthey are known as frogs in the united states dialog three \ni really want to buy you the plaid skirt no this design will make me appear \noverly chubby no way why you think that your thin is a rail \nyou'd blow away in the breeze if you were thinner in fact i believe a dark hue would be \npreferable it is the basic color and also easy to coordinate with other colors \nthe whole wardrobe is dark it looks boring i think you should lighten up \nokay perhaps you're correct i could wear a lighter hue but not that plaid \nit appears to be overly childish it's the new trend in autumn do you not \nread any fashion magazines oh so do you often read fashion \nmagazines yeah i'm interested in seeing how they match the new season's colors and keep \nup to date with new trends are you certain that is all you do \nmaybe you enjoy looking at fashion models \nhousehold objects and tools dialog one \nhey chris what exactly are you looking for i'm looking for remote control i don't \nsee it anywhere tv remote no i'm referring to the dvd player \nis it absolutely necessary yeah if i need to pause the movie or \nchange to a different scene have you looked for it everywhere \nis it trapped in the couch i looked for it there how long has it been since you last saw \nit i was watching the news this morning i was using it to switch channels \nhmm so where could it be i also wonder where it is \noh here in the midst of a heap of newspapers oh well i'm curious how it got there \ni don't know anyway thanks for finding it what would you do if you didn't have me \ndialogue too fortunately my roommate moved to another apartment \nwhy did you say that she was always utilizing my items without my permission \nshe arbitrarily used my ruler paper stapler tape and other supplies \ndid you remind her no i have not you know it might be tough to mention \nthese topics with friends or roommates at times you should have probably stated the \nground rules first you wouldn't have been so irritated if she hadn't utilized your belongings \nyes i will notify my roommate not to use my belongings without my consent the next time \nor even better i won't have a roommate that would save a lot of time and effort \nlive and learn as they say maybe you're right politics \ndialogue one who are you going to vote for that is a secret i don't think i need to \ntell you really but i can tell you i voted for hollins \nallen's why he's such an idiot oh \nso you must have voted for roberts sure i did he has very serious plans for \nactual transformation and how do you suppose he'll perform all that he's told \nthere's a budget surplus the government has extra money it's not enough for all his schemes he \nattends to boost taxes i'm willing to spend a bit more if it means a better quality of life for all \nof us pay more taxes i don't want to \nwhy although holland stated that he would not raise taxes this does not make him a good president \nas a result he is a low-cost president he'd let me spend my money as i wanted \ninstead of paying more taxes why don't you agree to pile more taxes \nobviously not they didn't earn it i did so i want to spend on what i want \nwhat about those less fortunate than us are you going to take care of them \ni suppose so if individuals like you aren't willing to do it \ndo you believe you have all the answers at the very least i'm considering the \nquestions dialogue two [Music] \ni'm sure you're relieved your time on the city council is done \nyeah it's really a lot of pressure and sometimes it was a headache \nwhy do you say that you can satisfy some of the people all the time and all of the people some of \nthe time abraham lincoln observed but he can't satisfy all the people all the time \nthat quote i believe is incorrect i believe it was fool the people rather than pleasing the people \nyou know there was no way you could please everyone all the time that's quite typical someone will always \nobject to something no matter what you say or do i'm not sure why people like politics so \nmuch it always makes them stressed it's worth getting into politics \nand i was just elected to the city council consider working in state or federal government \nwell i must say that i appreciate your behavior if only more people were like you it \nwould be worthwhile media dialogue one \n[Applause] what are you now reading \noh i see there's a topic in the paper i'm not sure whether i agree with the author what is the article about \ni believe his political viewpoints are skewed everyone has their own opinion \ni think the journalist should not put his personal opinion in the article except for an editorial story \noh my each newspaper has its own style some papers are liberal while others are \nconservative i know but this author appears to be prejudiced toward the \npresident and you don't agree honestly his point is very convincing \nsimply consider what he says will you remember it i'm still trying to do that \nit is beneficial to read stuff with which you disagree it helps to keep your mind sharp \nyeah this newspaper makes me unable to refute because my theoretical point is too sketchy \nsee that is true for everyone and it is wonderful to recognize that \njust wait till i read another tale in favor of the president dialogue two \n[Applause] i don't believe the station does a good \njob of covering the news i don't agree being a news director must be a demanding job \nso what is its difficulty they must pick which news is the most significant or what to start with this \nis what draws viewers in that shouldn't be that difficult it is just what is happening around the globe \nno not always perhaps they want to start with a less important story that hasn't yet been reported \nthen they must select whether to do a live interview a short video or a long video \nit shouldn't be an issue because there is so much news however everything must be timed to the \nsecond the newscasters must practice pronouncing the names of overseas cities \nand leaders furthermore they cannot be a second too short or a second too long \nhow did you know all this i have a master's degree in journalism and have taken some broadcasting classes \ni also did a radio program or a public service announcement \nyou have a lot of talent no not at all oh and did i mention that i also did \ncommunity news for a radio station dialogue 3 \nwhich newspaper do you like to read the star tribune is my go-to source for \nbreaking news however for local events i like the post review what about the cambridge \noh their news is not about what i'm interested in i enjoy the editorials and the star \ntribune particularly those by the guest editor realism i'm thinking of sending an editorial to \nthem really what subject will it be about my thoughts on zoning rules and \nrestrictions i believe the city is not doing enough to curb urban sprawl \ni concur that's a terrific idea for a topic on that point i believe everyone would \nagree with you [Music] have you forgotten about the developers \nof real estate if i fired some bullets at them they'd be as enraged as hornets \nhowever it is ultimately up to the city council to enact zoning rules and boundaries \nall right i'll do it then daily english speaking practice \nget disappointed [Music] \n[Laughter] what's wrong layla why are you crying i just failed one module \n[Music] oh really was the test difficult no it's all about me i didn't study \nenough i feel so disappointed to myself tell me what happened \nit was so lazy so i didn't study until the last day then on that day i was sick

saying nonsense \ni think we should call the doctor quickly [Music] \ntravel adam and jean are a couple planning for their one week getaway at \nthe end of december hey adam i think it is about time we start \nplanning on our holidays sure i'm not busy at the moment \ngreat because i have just found an ideal place for our getaway \nit is a seaside resort with luxurious services i got the place from allen he went there \nin the summer and he said it was fantastic staying there \nthe place seems nice but he went there in the summer would the place be as any more \ncomfortable in the winter season let me check the location online \ni haven't researched it myself only just heard about it from alan \nwhat is the name of the resort it's the coralina resort \nit is somewhere on the west coast of california \nthere seems to be no room left at the place it's all book really how unfortunate for us \nthe resort is pretty pricey though it would most likely be over budget for us \nabout our budget was it hundred dollars or twenty five hundred \ndollars that we have agreed on it was only fifteen hundred dollars but \nwe can go up to two thousand dollars if you want i have got a raise a month ago remember \nobviously the more the better it will surely give us more flexibility \nit is settled then we can afford a decent trip with two thousand dollars \nbut that will include what we want to bring with us before the trip right \ncertainly but i'm sure it wouldn't take up much we will have to make a rough estimate \nlater after we decided on the list of necessary things i'm having a lot of things in my mind at \nthe moment but i guess i have to wait then take it slow gene or we will go nowhere \nokay now back to choosing the location \nhow about we go somewhere chilly but worth visiting in the winter i mean a getaway doesn't mean a week \nchilling in a resort we can take the time and have a small adventure \nthat sounds really interesting i think i can hook us up with a travel \nagency or some sort better yet a close friend of mine \ndo you remember chris he is the guy who organized my company's field trip it was awesome \ni'm guessing he would be as good this time only he can answer \nhey adam what's up hi chris i need to ask you a few questions \nare you free now i have about 20 minutes before i get back to work so if left you plenty of \ntime nice so are you free late december \naround the two weeks of the year i haven't had anything occupied me \nbesides my annual family reunion oh yeah that's a bumper \nwell gene and i are planning to take a trip somewhere and we're wondering if you can organize something \norganizing one wouldn't be so hard be the tour guide is way harder so have you got anything in mind \nwe were looking to spend our week at a resort but we decided that going on a road trip would be better \ngoing on a road trip in the winter season we have just thought of that moments ago \nwe would prefer a warmer route please but if not a wintry one with great snowy \nscenery would surely make my day most road trips wouldn't last more than \na few days though but i will give you some options along the way give me two days and i will fill you in \nwith the details you can count on me guys thank you very much chris \njust send us the bill nah that's okay no need for that \noh you sure are kind chris we're looking forward to hearing from you soon \ngoodbye guys bye chris he is a great guy isn't he \nhe sure is now that we got someone to take care of the details let's get on our stuff \nfinally we got to this i'm thinking of getting sunscreen sun shades and more warm clothes \nthe sun still works out in the winter you know and your jackets and sweaters are kind \nof old it's reasonable to me because we are going to need some warmth \nso a tent and some blankets would be neat we could have a rent a car too \nthat would be expensive it would be cheaper than staying in a resort for a week \nshould we bring canned food to yes and we will make a small campfire to \ncook them and perhaps some marshmallows and sweets i'm wholeheartedly agreeing \nsuch experiences should be well worth it flashlights and emergency supplies \na gps device would be very handy and where could we get a stable water \nsource i don't know i'm sure chris will have something for us \nso that's all i can't think of anything else me neither \nthe list is really long already these have taken more than half our budget \ni have just remembered i had a date with the dentist today i got an hour to prepare \nwe will get all these later sometimes in mid-november great i will go do my things \nbye adam bye gene \njane daisy and mary meet in a coffee shop to talking about jane's upcoming \nholiday in san francisco the u.s in the next month \nhi daisy hi mary haven't seen you guys for so long \nhi jane we are on time aren't we hi jane mary here tried her best to be on time \ntoday she ran into some troubles outside of her house \nwe managed it well but we better not talk about it okay then how are you guys doing \ni got promoted two months ago with a better salary and perks \nwork is stressful but i'm holding on pretty well lucky you \nyou must have worked so hard for that position it has been a long time since i last \ntaken a serious vacation if you need any advice on that you can count on us \nyeah i can be of great help when it comes to these matters i'm also in need of traveling \nsuggestions daisy this is the reason why i want to meet up with you guys \nwe know so what is hanging in your mind right now \ni'm worried about getting lost in san francisco \nservice is no stranger to me but the feeling of being alone in a big city upsets me from time to time \nis there anyone accompanying you well there will be james my brother but \nhe can only be by my side most of the time i want to enjoy the trip when he isn't around \ntake a stroll downtown or chill on the beach you are adventurous aren't ya \nadventurous yet easily disoriented unfortunately \nthat is true you can take a map with you at all times \njust in case your phone's battery died in the middle of the street tourist maps are sold everywhere in \npopular visiting sites you should find it quite easily \nmap reading isn't really hard you know i hope it wouldn't be very troublesome \nto carry a map everywhere the trade-off is worth it in my view \ni will do it then transportation wouldn't be a big problem though \nbuses and taxis are all over the place do you want to rent a bike i know that \nsan francisco has a lot of facilities and policies which promote bikes \noh i can ride bikes quite smoothly then this is an option you should really \nconsider it's generally cheap and safe too \ni hope there are renting stations near where you are staying and by the way \nwhere are you planning on staying well initially i planned to stay at my \nbrother's house but it would take me two hours of subway and bus rides to get there \nso instead i booked a hotel room with a reasonable price just 20 minutes away \nbut would that require you to get back early only the days that my brother is busy \nand i have to go alone and be aware of the urban area after dark you wouldn't know what danger is \nlurking in the dark i've got some things to defend myself with but yeah i'll be careful \nyou have put some thought into the trip i have been planning this for the last two weeks i'm very excited about the \ntrip it's the first solo trip i have ever taken i have long chosen the places i should \nvisit i would love to go on a holiday in san francisco someday \ndo you want to go with me on this trip i will pass the offer jane \ndeadlines are killing me such a bumper guys \nit's time for me to go i still have work to do to prepare for the trip it has been fun hanging out with you \nguys keep us updated about the trip okay \ni little daisy goodbye jane see you later guys \ncharles and jean have just come home from their vacation in miami they are unpacking things and talking \nabout the trip finally it felt like forever in the car \nhome sweet home let's get some rest now not now charles \nwe need to look through our things remember why do we need to do that again \nand why now and not later if we happen to forget something at the hotel or on the bus we could report it \nsoon enough i'm pretty sure i got all of my important things with me \nyou never know charles i just want to be sure okay then i will do this with you \nlet's start with my stuff i can never remember all of your cosmetics and skin \ncare i don't really expect guys to be able to keep track of everything we own \neven girls like me can forget simple necessities such as lipsticks \nand i have all seven of mine right here so this one is off the list \nso what's next i'm absolutely sure that all of my valuables are in this jewelry box i have \ntriple checked it yesterday and locked it so it is out of the way \nhow much did you invest into filling up that box of yours most of them were gifted to me by \nfriends and family i only have spent around two hundred dollars which is not \nmuch it's quite acceptable actually if one of my passions is expensive i'm \nmore than willing to go beyond that i appreciate the understanding \nwe have depleted our supply of face masks so make sure to go get some more \nlater today top of my to-do list my entire makeup box is passed \neverything is in its proper place with no damage whatsoever you were very protective of it \nthis is every girl's treasure chest you know yeah i've acknowledged \ni only have 45 dollars left in my purse we did spend a lot of money on souvenirs \nand local food but they were amazing and i couldn't stop myself \nme neither we can go on and on for days i still have around twenty dollars in my wallet \ni made sure we had some spare bucks for the trip back home oh no i've lost my sunglasses \ndid you wear it on our way home i didn't where could it be \ni have no idea gene i've not seen those sunglasses for two days \nreally i can't even recall the last time i wore it whatever that pair of sunglasses were \ncheap and uncomfortable anyway well that is all there is in my handbag \nlet's proceed to our suitcases i agree let's do mine first \ni'm eager to hand the new dreamcatcher thing i got three days ago on our bedroom wall \nyou really did run through your holiday clothes yup all of them are dirty so i didn't \neven bother putting them into separate bags you are just lazy \ni will let you do your own clothes i will only check the accessories and souvenirs okay \nit's for the best do you remember what you have bought \nthe dream catcher is one thing on the way home i also bought a cute little statue that can be used as a \npaperweight found it what's next the books that i brought with us \nthis thick lords of the ring fellowship of the ring book so this is what you were so deep \ninto that you left me waiting for an hour yesterday i can't believe it too time flies when \nthat book is in my possession have you finished it yet only half of it it's very long \ni have no interest in being left alone because of a book i know i know \ni wouldn't let it get in our way anymore thank you so are there any other books i \nneed to be aware of that's the only one i plan to bring two more but there wasn't enough space in \nthe luggage i've also held back my desire to buy one from the gift shop \nyou did a great job charles did you get anything from the gift shop gene \nno i wasn't very fascinated with anything in there the woodworks aren't my style \nhey gene check if my phone charger is in there let's see here it is \nthanks my phone needs it badly [Music] is that all you've got \nthere is also my bag of personal hygiene caring i will check the things inside myself \napart from that there is nothing more to concern where are your headphones by the way \nin my pocket here i've been using it quite a lot it's for the audiobooks you've been \ntalking about and for my weird music days too \nwell you do you then so my luggage passed your test \npretty much great because i have some business to do in the bathroom \nget going then i'll join you later don't miss me too much \ni don't want you to watch me unpack my luggage anyway [Music] \nworking part-time jobs daniel is hiring some employees to work \na part-time job mike is one of the applicants \nhello mike take a seat thank you sir \ncan i see your resume please i have received the online version of \nyour cv but i just wanted to be sure here you go sir \neverything you require is in that document case you got quite an interesting history for \na student of your age mike there seems like nothing is out of the \nordinary just relax kid this is just for a part-time job \nusually these so-called interviews aren't as strict as the more long-termed ones \nbut nevertheless i want you to know if you are right for the job so tell me mike what brings you here \nwell sir i wanted to apply for a part-time job to get used to the roughness of society \nso through hours of applying i'm here and do you expect to be paid handsomely \nno i don't sir the experience of working is enough to keep me going \ni'm sorry if this is offensive but no undergraduates apply for a part-time job without having money as a goal in their \nmind i understand sir and i am sorry \nplease just call me dan or mr dan and no need to be sorry \nso how has your university life been mike it has been great actually \ni'm a freshman of international business major i've managed to become an official \nmember of one of my school's clubs being socially open aren't ya \nit's nice to see one fit in easily with his surroundings so i assume that you are communicating \nskill is at a decent level i wouldn't really consider my talking \nskills anywhere near charming but still natural nevertheless \ncool that's all i expected mike now how about your \nother skills such as multitasking or concentration \ni'm not very good at multitasking but i can put my mind into a single thing for \na long period of time that is very beneficial in the future \nfor you what about your time management ability \ni know that freshman year at university can be overwhelming but \ncan you be self-organized enough to make sure the deadline is met \ni can prioritize particular tasks based on their importance i am confident \nas i can mr dan your attitude is straightforward and honest isn't it mike \nbut anyway before we end this short interview i would like to advise you \nsomething leave out some time for you to rest and balance between studying socializing and working okay \nthank you for the advice mr dan i appreciate the advice \nwell then here is your resume have a good day sir \ngoodbye mike remember to close the door behind you \ndave is working a part-time job at a grocery store \njordan accidentally met him and sticks around to talk \ni will have these oh hey jordan long time no see \ndave oh wow i didn't expect to see an old homie around \nyeah it has been ages since we last from high school isn't it \nsince we graduated oh wait let me check these out for you first \nit's 14.65 here are your groceries mind if i stick around for a bit \nno problem bro it's not every day that i bump into an old mate \nand i'm not very busy at this time of day so how long have you been working here \nfor about a month and a half or so it's pretty uneventful working here so \nthis job is fine but this is only a part-time job though \ni haven't graduated yet well it's only two years since we left \nhigh school i only started university a year ago for multiple reasons \nreally which university do you attend it would sound a bit odd but have you \nheard about the university of people it's kind of familiar but i can't really \npinpoint what it is i swear i have heard about it somewhere \nit's a free university where people around the world can attend for free as \nlong as they have an internet connection and a full commitment \noh i remember that university is very well known for its good deeds and dedication \nyes i'm really glad and excited when i got recommended by relative \nmy life has really turned up from there because i'm flexible in my study i still \nhave time to work some part-time jobs to feed myself and help out my parents \nthis is only my night time job my daytime job offers wage but it's \nequally more stressful what do you do here anyway \ni never get an insight about this sort of work well as the cashier my main job is to \nscan these groceries and collect the money but behind the counter there are a lot \nof other minor things to do such as when the manager isn't here i'm \ntasked with recording and writing down any cargo delivery and report it to him \nkeep the shelves stocked and deal with any product shortages \napart from the regular works i have to deal with every emergency around \nsometimes that fridge over there breaks down or the front door is jammed etc \nusually there would be a guy working the same shifts as me but today he is coming late \nhe told me that he would arrive an hour late which means he will be here in \n10 minutes so i'm the only one keeping you company \nyeah pretty much i appreciate this it could get extremely \nboring around here anytime man anytime \nso how much do you guys earn from working here typically eight dollars an hour every \nday there are no extras in rush hours or holidays \nthis place would close during holidays or maintenance days but there are great pulses at this place \ni get to be paid every weekend so i can keep up with any surprise bills \nthat's great for you man i hardly know anywhere else with such good policies \nbut anyway it's a dead end job nevertheless \nwhat about the other jobs you have well i also work around the logistics \ncenter next to the supermarket i'm only the apprentice at the place \nfollowing the manager where he does his daily routine i've learned a lot of things there \nalready the boss there took great care of me things seemed to be looking up for you \nhuh would there be any chance it would lead to a full-time job \nmost likely yes i saw a lot of potential for growth at the place \non the online university i talked about there is a logistics course really suited for my needs \nin only one year i've got most of the basic knowledge of how to run a logistics business and manage \nworking at this place also gives me hands-on experience and logistics \nthat's why i stayed at this place working at a seemingly minimum wage \nwow you got such an admirable spirit for studying and working \ni'm really impressed with how everything has turned up for you opportunities come from education \ni'm happy for you man seeing an old dude thriving thanks man you're a nice guy \nwell it's about time for me to go keep up the good work okay my dude \ni will man i will goodbye dude [Music] \nthree days
