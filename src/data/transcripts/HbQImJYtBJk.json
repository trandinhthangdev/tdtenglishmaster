\nthe race is no longer talked about on television if they talked about race they would be \nseen as racists but how do we recognize someone if we don't know what race they are \njust bear it then they shouldn't inform us if the thief is male or female because it would \nbe sexist use a tissue \nUse a Tissue \ni do not use your sleep to wipe your nose but i don't have a tissue \nthen go to the

painting by a famous artist \nunbelievable last week i went to an exhibition i saw \na painting of a jar filled with pencils but according to the artist the jar was \nboth full and empty but it was packed with pencils how could \nhe claim that it was empty artists have a unique perspective on the \nworld have you ever seen any of picasso's paintings \ncertainly he's well known all around the world i still can't believe it \nin third grade i drew similar artworks where are they gone they may be worth \nmillions of dollars life is for living \nLife Is for Living \nwhat is the point of this i don't get what you mean \nof being alive i'm not sure we live and then \nwe're all eventually going to die and be forgotten we've got to be here for a reason \nmaybe you were just here to have a good time then why am i not having \nfun because you're overthinking it do you mean i should stop thinking \n[Music] stop wondering what the point is alright i'll think of happy things \nall you have

\nPatch It or Sew It? \nthe front pocket of my jeans has a hole in it pens should not be carried in your \npocket yesterday a pen slipped through my trousers and landed on my shoe \nfortunately it wasn't a sharp knife who keeps a razor sharp knife in their \npocket [Music] of course criminals in any case i need to repair the hole \nyou can either stitch it or use an iron-on patch please explain this patch to me \nthe patch contains glue the hot iron melts the adhesive allowing the patch to adhere to the garment \nthat appears to be a lot easier than sewing yes it is the adhesive however washes \nout after approximately 10 washings what's so funny \nWhat's So Funny? \ndo you have any funny jokes i'm terrible at remembering jokes \ni can't they pass through one year and out the other \nwho comes up with all these joke stories i'm not sure every day though there must \nbe a hundred new ones yes but only in english \ni'm curious whether every language contains jokes certainly

about males \nSpanish Spoken Here \nspanish spoken here you're really fortunate \nwhat makes you say that you're fluent in two languages \nmy english isn't great to be sure no one is fluent in english

anniversary no today's earth day \nwhat is it it serves as a yearly reminder to care for our world \noh you mean we should reuse and recycle everything of course we must think green save water \nand eliminate the use of plastic bags what about taking shorter showers \nthat's a smart idea because showers use a lot of water from now on i will only shower for 20 \nminutes or less no time for rhyme \nNo Time for Rhyme \n[Music] poetry is a waste of time \ni'm not aware of anyone that enjoys it however there are some pretty good poems \nyeah those poems that rhyme are easy to remember like \none two buckle my shoe although poems are out of favor now \nindividuals continue to compose poetry and nobody earns any money doing it \nwilliam shakespeare was a poet did he get wealthy as a result of his \npoetry most likely not poems are similar to songs \nthat's correct but songs contain music songs would be unlistenable if there was \nno music to accompany them dumb and happy \nDumb and Happy \nhow clever are you no i'm not too smart i'm just a normal \nperson have you ever taken an intelligence test \nno i've never done it i just knew that i received a's and b's in school \ni wish i was

law of the universe i mean will you be buried or cremated \nmy wife and i are going to be cremated [Music] will you be buried next to each other \nno our ashes will be scattered in the sea are you sure you don't want to be buried \na coffin is both expensive and takes up too much room \nyes but it'll be at a cemetery where your children will be able to pay their respects \nthe children rarely pay their respects to their parents in a cemetery \ni think so too a cemetery is for the dead not for the living \nwe believe our sons would come to see us anytime they go to the beach \nwipe your feet you were barefoot right \nWipe Your Feet \nyes but i wiped my feet what are those muddy footprints on the \nfloor i'm not sure it's not my footprint \nwell who has not washed their feet and

do however not on our flag every country's flag should include a \nbeautiful woman you can't go to battle with a flag that has a lady on it \nwork up an appetite today is a busy morning \nWork up an Appetite \nwhat exactly did you do i watered every plant \ndo you plant a lot of trees that's right then i washed clothes \nit's quite time consuming i went for a stroll with the dog \ni'm sure he had

for a Dollar \nmy house phone does not have long distance service how do you make long distance phone \ncalls i have a business card from whence did you acquire that \ni buy them at the post office
