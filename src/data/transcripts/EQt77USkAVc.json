restaurant good in \nour eyes that's an interesting question \nI mean the food is obviously crucial but \nfor me the overall atmosphere or \nAmbience of the place is equally \nimportant it sets the mood for the meal \nI totally agree I've been to places with \ngreat food but if it's too noisy or if \nthe seating is uncomfortable it takes \naway from the \nexperience the ambience has to \ncomplement the kind of food they serve \nspot on and then there's the \nservice I remember we went to that \npopular Italian place downtown and even \nthough the food was commendable the \nservice was so slow and \ninattentive yes good service can enhance \nyour dining experience while bad service \ncan ruin even the most delicious meal \nand that's where restaurant reviews come \nin handy they

\nrelated to cooking or the preparation of \nfood example the culinary skills of the \nchef at that restaurant are truly \nexceptional Ambience or \nAmbience explanation this is the mood or \nfeeling associated with a particular \nplace often created by its surroundings \nor \nenvironment example the Ambiance of the \npath by the beach was calm and relaxing \nwith soft music playing in the \nbackground \ncommendable explanation this is used to \ndescribe something that deserves praise \nor \nadmiration example the students efforts \nin the community service project were \ncommendable \nsignature explanation in this context \nsignature refers to something that is a \ndistinguishing feature or characteris \nistic of someone particularly relating \nto their skills or \ncreation example the chef is known for \nhis signature chocolate dessert which is \na favorite among \ncustomers jot down explanation this \nmeans to write something quickly or \nbriefly often without much
