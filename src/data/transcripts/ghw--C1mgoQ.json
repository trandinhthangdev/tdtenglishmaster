an accident last weekend \nyou should have told me sooner so i could help you at that time if you needed me don't worry i'm okay now \nbut where in a forest i want to drive out to chill \nout oh i drove onto a small road in the forest \nand had an accident how there was a bad day for me \nwhile i was driving a squirrel ran across the road \ni was startled so i steered to avoid it and unfortunately i crashed into a bush on the side of the road \nthat's awful how about you was there any injury \ni was okay but my car wasn't it seemed to be a bit of an engine failure but i didn't have a repair kit \nand then i was so regretful i should have brought the repair kit \nright you know what [Music] the squirrel saw me he crossed the \nstreet he panicked and ran away oh as if he knew he had made a mistake i \nthink so so how did you go home oh the story was even worse \nthe car was going back very slowly because the engine was broken the cars behind beat their horns and \ncomplained and told me to hurry but i couldn't i should have chosen another road that \nis wider why didn't you stop and let another car go first \ni wish so but the road goes one way and it only has enough one car to go \ni felt frustrated but also apologetic you should have called for help sooner \ni thought so too but also fortunately the road is short \nand i tried to press on the accelerator fortunately it went faster \nit is good i was so happy but because i was so happy i crashed \ninto another car why are you so unlucky \nyou should have been careful i don't know i was so scared and got out of the car \napologizing to him immediately and promising to be careful \nso what did he say can you guess i was so scared when i saw him \nwhy were you scared of him if you were there i'm sure you also feel like me \nhe is very bigger taller than me a lot as i imagined it's normal isn't it \nno way look he wanted to hit me i thought of a robber he was just \nwaiting for me to come and take all my money oh my god you should have called the \npolice immediately because i was so scared i gave all my money to make up for it but more \nsurprising you know what what \ni helped him what that car got into a quagmire thanks to \nme hitting it it got out of that quagmire oh god \ni was very relieved when i resolved the misunderstanding with the other car owner \nthat's great [Music] right after that i got some lessons that i \nhave to bear in mind you should be more careful on the road \nexactly and i should have prepared everything for a trip especially for unexpected situations \nluckily you go home safely and there was not any injury that's right \n[Music] \nmary asked her husband jack to help improve her driving skills but things didn't go the way she expected
