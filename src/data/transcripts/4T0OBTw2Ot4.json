    "transcript": "[Music] \nenglish conversations job \n[Music] hopping dialogue one [Music] \nyou look energetic today i think today will be a great day for you wish your \njob favorable and successful thanks today is my first day at the new \ncompany great what position are you applying for \ni work in the field of research and development are you still working on the project \nyeah right so why not make a change are there a lot of firms searching for professionals \nto be honest with you this is a great work for me \ndialogue 2. [Music] \nafter the spring festival i will apply to big companies have you made up your mind \nyeah a lot of my friends plan to do the same which company are you going to apply to \ni intend to apply to lux corporation it is a leading corporation in the field of logistics \nso great you will learn a lot of things at a big corporation \nyeah i think it's time to put myself to the test best wishes to you \n[Music] \nfurther study and going abroad dialogue one \n[Music] \nwhen did you complete your college education i received my diploma \nare you planning to study further do you mean pursuing a master's degree \nyeah you will have more job opportunities when you study for a master's degree \nyou know when you study for a master's degree it can be a substantial investment costing you both time and \nmoney so you don't plan to study for a master's degree \nyeah i need to go to work as soon as possible to support my family my parents \nhealth is deteriorating i get what you mean \n[Music] \ndialog 2. [Music] \ni know you graduated in 2012 and then pursued a master's degree \nwell as you said i already have a master's degree english is your major \nhave you ever considered going abroad ah no in my opinion english is only a \ntool for communication during my additional study term i chose law as my \nmajor law majors are also very hot these years you will have a brighter future this way \n[Music] \ncarpooling for work [Music] dialogue one [Music] \nmy car is being repaired so i have to take the bus every day you know taking the bus is terrible \ncome on it's not that bad but it truly is as an example in this morning \nthis morning the bus was very crowded on my way to work i was completely \nsquashed by approximately a hundred harried commuters \nwhy not join a carpool huh that's also a good idea but i'm not \nsure who i would carpool with \ndialog 2. \n[Music] how do you go to work every day \ni drive myself to work having your own car is very convenient \nnot very convenient since last year the government has prohibited automobiles \nwith even an odd-numbered license plates from driving on alternating days \noh it's very inconvenient so can't you drive every day \nyeah on those days when cars are banned i usually take the bus \nor you can locate someone on your route home and start a carpool with them [Music] \noffice romance [Music] dialogue one \ni have a major crush on lily i'm going to see if i can get her to dinner this weekend \nthe supervisor had warned us not to combine love and work that's ridiculous but it's my private \nspace supervision can't stop me from getting to know people in the same company \nbut wait a minute i've heard she's already dating someone i'm not talking about a date here just a \nmeal however most start with a meal and quickly lose control \nugh it's sad to know she has a boyfriend \n[Music] dialogue too \n[Music] \ni believe that young people nowadays spend an increasing amount of time in workplaces \nyes it causes a large number of people to be single office romance on the other hand is \npretty frequent these days are you in favor of it or against it \ni don't know it depends on a lot of factors what do you mean \nit's hardly unexpected that romance develops in the workplace however remember not to date the boss \ndating your boss is extremely dangerous [Music] \ngiving gifts \n[Music] hello eliza have you planned anything \nfor the holiday yet i am thinking about it \ni need to prepare some gifts for my parents when i come back home \nyes the holiday season is coming up and many kinds of gifts for new year's are now available at the market \nnew year is the biggest holiday in my country so gifts are necessary \nso when do people give gifts or presents in your country in my country people give presents on \nsome different occasions such as wedding anniversaries birthdays \nparents day or valentine's day perhaps when people buy their first \napartment or home they also give gifts people also give gifts during religious \nfestivals like christmas holidays and sometimes they give gifts at graduation ceremonies \ni agree what kinds of gifts do you usually choose \ni usually take something like some flowers for my grandmother i know she loves flowers so they always \nmake her happy which is great i give chocolate and jewelry for women \nwhile wallets are watches for men since these are very much useful in a man's everyday life \ni think you like giving expensive gifts right yes i feel like giving valuable presents \nmeans giving importance to the person who receives the gifts but i think those gifts still have \nreasonable price and are decent you know i'm not as generous as i should \nbe and i'm rather tight-fisted when it comes to usually giving presents only on \nbirthdays yeah we should only make sure that the gift \nwill bring a smile to the face of the receiver that's true \ndo you spend a lot of time choosing gifts i really enjoy looking for gifts for \npeople because it is really gratifying to be a part of a good cause \nespecially if it involves making someone happy \nwell i am totally the opposite for me it also gives me an idea as to \nwhat kinds of new gift items are available at the market because you work in the industry \nthat makes sense what about your time while choosing presents \nso to answer your question i love to buy a suitable gift for others but i do not spend hours after hours \ndoing so instead i visit a large shop or an online store that has numerous gift \nitems and then i quickly pick a gift but do you think sending gifts is \nimportant of course yes the purpose of giving gifts is to \nshow how much someone means to us and to celebrate the person who the gift is in honor of \ni would like to add that it can also be aimed at amending our past bitterness \nand misunderstandings in order to refresh our relationship \non the other hand giving and receiving today has become a commercial activity \nsometimes we are forced to give and receive gifts i totally agree with your point \nnowadays presents are much more symbolic rather than substantial or useful \npeople these days often give and receive technology related gifts which were quite rare in the past \ni would say that in the past specifically 10 years ago the types of gifts exchanged were \nprimarily clothes toys household appliances and books \napart from the fact that they weren't related to technology they were also significantly important \neducational and in most cases really expensive \nglobalization has given us products for more places around the world to enjoy \nand online shopping has made it a lot easier for us to acquire them without \nthe hassle of going to shops i only like something practical \nit might be kind of boring but i like to get things like socks and underwear because i always need those \nand i don't like shopping for those things \ni rarely see anyone giving underwears presents dan \nthat's my dream or perhaps food or drink food or drink is more suitable \nif it's a friend's house then i will give you a bottle of wine or something like that \noh i just realized i often have different ideas for gifts i also tend to travel a \nlot so i always try to bring back souvenirs for family and friends so i can share in some small way my \nexperience do you prefer sending or receiving gifts \ni like to be given something it's exciting to unwrap a present and see what it is \nalso it shows that someone cares about you or maybe it just means they want something in return \n[Laughter] so what is the last time you received a gift \noh this is hilarious just a couple hours ago i received a bag of sweet potatoes \nfrom the owner of the mini supermarket at the corner of my street i still don't know why she gave me but \nshe said not to worry about paying for them it was a complete surprise but a really \nnice gesture by her is she close to you that much \nnot really that's why i was quite shocked when is your last time \nmy friends presented me with a few books on my last birthday they bought four novels that they knew i \nwanted to read and surprised me on my birthday two of these books are written by john \ngrissom the other two are the fault in our stars and the \nhandmaid's tale i know those two books too the content is really good \nyes and i received some money on my birthday as well what do you think about giving money as \na gift it's a down-to-earth choice since then the receiver can put that money to use \non pressing matters or get something that they will really enjoy and it's a safe \nchoice for events like birthdays or weddings that's true \nanyway i'm going to the supermarket now to have a look at gifts \nbye hope you choose many knife gifts for relatives \n[Music] \nwedding situation one amelia and her daughter sophie go to her \nfriend's wedding sophie is so excited she asks her mom about the wedding she has attended \nwow everything is so pretty like paradise i like this pink theme what do you think \nmom [Music] i like it too a beautiful wedding is every girl's \ndream even myself back then i saw photos of your wedding it was \namazing too mom the most important thing was to marry my favorite person which is your dad \ni hope that i have a wedding like that one day how much do you reckon it costs to pull \nthis wedding off i think it cost them a lot of money \ndo you hope to have a wedding as big as theirs i don't think so i want to have a bigger \nwedding why do you want to have a bigger wedding i want to have a large wedding that \neveryone will remember you can have a small wedding and people \nwill still remember it as long as you marry your love your wedding will be perfect \nhave you ever attended someone's wedding who were they yes a lot \nsome of my cousins friends colleagues but the most memorable one is my best \nfriends who went with you i went with one of my classmates \nwhere was the wedding organized it was held in a restaurant downtown \nwas it amazing how many people were there [Applause] \nit was great and it was a small wedding only her close friends and relatives were invited \nwhat did people do at the wedding they enjoyed the wedding feast \nsang and danced together after giving the couple the best wishes of everlasting happiness \nwhat did the bride and groom wear the bride wore a white wedding gown \nwhile the groom wore a black suit and tie what was the most interesting ritual at \nthe wedding exchanging rings is the ritual i'm quite interested in \nit was so emotional a lot of people cried the groom and bride's eyes were \nsparkling and then i knew they were meant for each other \nour weddings especially vent in someone's life yes along with birthdays \nbecause we only marry once or taught twice usually and the ceremony is intimate and special \nthings like that don't happen a lot do people get married early \nnot really the average age to get married for women is 27 and for men is 29. \nwhat is the ideal age to get married in your opinion well \n27 would be my ideal age women are most charming and mature at \nthat age i guess how have weddings changed recently \nthe most noticeable change is the reduction of rituals in a wedding \nthere used to be more steps in weddings years ago than there are now like what mom \nfor example after the ceremony the bride had to speak to her parents first \nor the family of the bride would essentially pay the husband to be a sum of money \nas a sort of thanks for being willing to marry their daughter that's so strange nobody does that \nanymore and a couple needed to bury a bottle of bourbon at their wedding site \nexactly one month before the ceremony to have a sunny sky on their wedding \nit was more complicated and superstitious back then i want a simple wedding without any of \nthose old-fashioned and weird traditions sure honey \nwhen it's about time we will plan your wedding together thank you mom it will be so much fun \n[Music] \nsituation 2 henry flies to america from england to attend his friend michael's wedding \nhe's curious about the wedding traditions in america so he discusses with michael's friend dave about the \ntraditions in england in america hi henry welcome to america \nthank you so much for being here it means a lot michael it's my pleasure \nthis is the first time i attended an american wedding i'm so excited \ncome this way this is your seat thanks so i heard that american weddings are \ndifferent from weddings in england couples living in england do not have as many pre-wedding activities as those in \nthe united states really what activities do you guys have \nwell we do have bachelor and bachelette parties we do not hold bridal showers or rehearsal dinners \nare bachelor and bachelorette parties in the uk different from those in the us \nwhile the party themes in the uk are extravagant the budget is it excessive \nthe average brit spends about 507 euros on their weekend pre-wedding parties \nin the u.s bachelor party attendees spend on average of 738 dollars for the festivities while \nbachelorette party attendees spend about 472 dollars \nthe actual ceremony is quite different too oh \nin england the wedding party is usually small the bride walks down the aisle before \nher bridesmaids the groom keeps his back towards the bride as she walks down the aisle \nin here the groom faces the bride for the entire procession but i think the british tradition is better \nthat's the tradition we love most the groom faces away from the bride until she reaches him and everyone gets \nto experience their first look how about the bridesmaids and groomsmen \nin the uk instead of a maid of honor a bride selects a chief bridesmaid \nbritish bridesmaids sit during the ceremony while most american bridesmaids stand beside the bride throughout the service \ndo the groomsmen give funny toasts like in the u.s british wedding toasts are more like \nroasts but they're still polite and the jokes are pretty simple the speeches also don't take up much \ntime in america it's customary for the best man in the maid of honor to make a short \nspeech and maybe even one of the parents that's not something you'll see in \nbritish weddings only men tend to make the speeches and the main objective is \nto embarrass the couple have you been to medi weddings in your country \nactually this is the first wedding i've attended i heard that if you're british the first \nwedding you attend might be your own that's right the british have a strict rule \nno ring no bring if a couple is not married the guests significant other is not invited to the \nceremony or reception following how about close friends and family \nmembers that are unmarried there's a separate reception later at night for those close friends and family \nunmarried guests are invited to bring their significant others to this reception \nthis person has to truly be a significant other oftentimes engaged to be invited \nin america we are given an open invitation for a plus one is this reception similar to the \nreception in the u.s dinner is served with dancing to follow \nthere is also a bar at the evening reception not at the lastly the couple often gives their own \ntoasts to each other and their guests \nthe evening reception is more intimate right yes but there's one key difference if \nyou brought a gift you'll feel out of place really \nyes gifts are always mailed directly to the couple and never brought to the ceremony \nor reception that's a good idea a big gaudy array of wrapped presents \ndoesn't exactly make the party any better i know when i get married i will invite you so \nyou can attend an actual british wedding thanks i'm looking forward to it \n[Music] \nwinter activities dialogue one chloe and mia are high \nschool friends they catch up at a tea house after not seeing each other for a while \nhello ladies what tea would you like to have

and be active \ni miss when it was sunny i could stay outside all day and play all kinds of sports \nyou know we can still play sports in the winter right like ice skating playing hockey or \nsnowboarding you're right but i don't have the equipment needed for those sports \nthen let's just go outside and make some snow angels or have a snowball fight \nthat actually sounds like fun let's
