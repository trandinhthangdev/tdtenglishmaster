heat is it that simple with enough heat and time \nthat placid pot of water will turn into a bubbling boiling cauldron full of hot \nsteamy water when you boil water where do the bubbles originate from \nwhen water is boiled it undergoes a physical change the molecules of water don't break apart \ninto hydrogen and oxygen and then change physically from liquid to a gas \nthe gaseous form is water vapor all of this is physics isn't it \nyeah to convert a liquid to a gas via boiling the liquid must be heated \nfor water 212 degrees fahrenheit 100 degrees celsius is considered the \nboiling point of water then the bubbles will disappear \nwhen the water is boiled the heat energy is transferred to the molecules of water \nwhich begin to move more quickly then they form gaseous molecules of \nwater vapor which flow to the surface as bubbles and travel into the air \n[Music] topic the blue sky \nTOPIC: The blue sky \n[Music] \njoe just asked me a question regarding science but i don't

multi-colored right gases and particles in earth's \natmosphere scatter sunlight in all directions blue light is scattered more than other \ncolors because it travels the shorter smaller waves this is why we see a blue sky most of \nthe time right what about the other \ncolors they reflect off the objects they collide with \ni don't understand for example your clothing is red because \nour eyes reflect red light now i understand why the sky is blue \n[Music] \nTOPIC: A new camera \ntopic a new camera \ni recently purchased a digital camera what's the matter with your old camera \nnothing
